22 December 2006,Tom Hanks' best performance,,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful."
22 December 2015,a box of chocolate,,"more than adaptation , it is a visual parable. about vulnerability and its magnificent potential. about innocence and its importance to discover the real essence of life. about love, family, fight and courage. a film like a revolution. because it propose the best manner to be yourself and to not be a victim walking on that way. more than story of Forrest Gump, it is the story of people around him. a film like a Rubick cube - many faces, each for complete right color. and a image who remains its mark - the box of chocolate, the run, the ping - pong match. it seems be the best role of Tom Hanks. in fact, it is definition of a new period after the Cold War. a pledge. about the small things."
6 September 2015,"Forrest, Forrest Gump.. The greatest.",,"There is an unfortunate time when you watch this film, its not the film thats the problem its my highly evident fear of the next few films I watch just seeming so bad. For simply not being this. Its everything. Its a romantic-comedy-tragedy-life-story-historical-personal- uplifting-war story. Every time I watch it I go on an emotional journey with the characters that are quickly built up in the world around Forrest. There is not much more I can say about this film that will say how much i like it, apart from award it the accolade that is; My favourite film. Over time the film stands up, the performances seem to get better knowing how Hanks has gone on to be a great actor. His supporting cast do a great job of making the world of the film feel believable."
15 February 2013,delicate silhouette,,"it is a beautiful film . for the slices of silence. it is a delicate work. for the unique performance of Tom Hanks. and, sure, it is a snow ball on the evening of Christmas Eve. in fact, it has not definition. only lines of feelings. and crumbs of childhood manner to discover the world. so, it remains magic and fascinating. because it keeps state of time and create another, very original form of line between reality and fiction. profound face of small things. and a travel to yourself with the others as borders. a fairy tale. and source of a form of emotion who remembers the real value of life. its purpose. its fake limits. form of deep freedom. axis of all - a delicate silhouette."
11 May 2016,"A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.",,"Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended."
6 February 2002,"""Bye Bye Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country.""",,"I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big').Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes. I think that any one could enjoy this movie, keeping in mind you know what your about to watch. 10/10"
1 November 2003,A reasonably enjoyable romp through recent history and pop culture  any more than that and it's a crass conservative message (spoilers),,"Sitting at a bus stop, Forrest Gump starts to take to those around him and tells a story of his life to date.  His is a fairly unremarkable life that spans recent history.  It begins with his childhood in Alabama and his growth from humble beginnings to take part in many memorable events in recent American history.I saw this when it came out and have seen it several times since then.  I haven't reviewed it until now because I've always felt that my views of this film were pushed one way or another by a) it winning lots of Oscars and b) everyone hammering it in comparison to Pulp Fiction.  It should be judged on it's own merits, so I watched it yesterday in an attempt to do that.  I felt that I could view it in one of two ways  either as a comical walk through recent history or as a message.As a special effects driven walk through recent history it is actually quite enjoyable.  It does get a bit tiresome to see Forrest meet one president after another, or invent popular songs/slogans/tee shirts/ bumper stickers etc but it still works quite well.  The subplot of his love for Jenny doesn't work as well in this context and actually serves only to slow things down a little and to create the cheesy climax to the film.  However this subplot is the basis for the film's `message'.  Jenny and Forrest both start out in the same place.  Forrest works hard without questioning anything, sure he gets some tough breaks but his dogged efforts eventually work out for him.  Jenny, on the other hand, gets involved in the other culture of the times  be it political rebellion, drugs, music, extramarital sex etc. Her fate is less than Forrest's  she dies and realises on her death dead that she should have just been clean cut like Forrest.  This side of the film smacks rather heavily  first of all it is all too sentimental but, more importantly, it is a clear attack on the counter cultures and a condemnation of those that are part of them.Of course the film's humour means that the two extremes of Forrest and Jenny are also played for laughs so even a flag burning, drug user may be won over by the film before it starts to deliver it's message drop and drop.  I tried just to enjoy the comic side of the film but it wasn't enough to fill the 2 hour plus run time and I started looking at the sub plot  and didn't like what I saw.The cast are all pretty OK.  I don't think for a moment that Hanks deserved his Oscar, but there's nothing more can be said of that.  He does do good work to play his `dumb' character so well but it shouldn't really have won no matter who else it was up against.  Penn is OK but only has to play `bad' for most of the film.  Sinise is pretty good value and his character is a mix, with the bitterness writ large on his life.  Williamson plays another `dumb' character but does OK and Field is alright as Forrest's Mom.  To be honest the cast all match the tone of the film  all good people who just keep plodding along and get good results.Overall I should take the film to be praise of an America where even those with 75 IQ's can make it, however this simply isn't true.  What remains once this is rejected is the comedy of seeing Hanks inserted into archive footage (to mostly amusing effect) and a crass and obvious attack on those who would go against whatever America stands for.  It's worth a watch but the crude message and effect driven humour simply didn't help me understand where all those Oscars came from."
11 September 1998,Will be classic in years to come,,"Forrest Gump is one of the best films Tom Hanks has done. In this 1994 film his portrayal of Forrest recaptures the sprit of his classic performance in Big (1988). The rest of the cast is also top notch with Sally Field and Gary Sinse turning in performances that deserved Oscars. Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R. Hall who plays Young Jenny will probably forever be associated with the line ""Run Forrest Run!"")In conclusion, a film which given time to mature will be a classic."
18 February 2024,Forrest Gump: A Story About Being Kind and Brave,,"""Forrest Gump"" isn't just a movie about a guy running through history. It's a touching story that shows us how unexpected life can be and how simple kindness can change the world. Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is a man who might not be the smartest by book standards, but his heart is bigger than most. He finds himself in the middle of big events from history, but it's his innocent view of life that really makes us think.This movie is special because it mixes real history with Forrest's personal adventures, making it feel like you're going on a journey with him. It's funny, sad, and heartwarming all at once. Forrest's way of seeing the world teaches us about love, friendship, and doing what's right, no matter how hard it gets.What's cool about ""Forrest Gump"" is that it's more than a history lesson. It's a reminder that being kind and true to yourself can lead to amazing things. It's a movie for anyone who's ever felt a little out of place, showing that it's okay to be different. In a world that can be tough and complicated, Forrest Gump is like a breath of fresh air, reminding us of the good in people."
23 July 2002,Over-rated and disappointing!,,"""Spoilers"" I must start by writing that I do not like this movie at all. Even though it began well I thought it became dull quite quickly because of the many uninteresting and pointless turns in the plot.We see Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting on a bench talking to a person who sits next to him about his life. When Forrest was young he had a lot of problems because he was a handicapped person. He meets a pretty girl on the school bus and begins to fall in love with her. When some envious and mean school children are chasing him he discovers he can run, finally overcoming his physical disability. This scene was amazing because it shows that people can overcome any diseases by having faith in themselves. Forrest Gump was a brave boy who tried to run, even when it was nearly impossible for him. That was an interesting beginning. However, when he grows up and graduates from college this movie turns out to be awful, as the only thing he does is keep talking about his life as a football player, as a runner and, ridiculously as a soldier, he's inexplicably the best soldier.  Forrest Gump seems to believe he's very interesting, that his achievements in life are extremely important and valuable to us, but they aren't. For instance, we see him getting medals and many other things, but I really didn't feel interested in what he received because he seems to be so arrogant, thinking he's the best person in the world. I didn't find myself quite absorbed in the film because I didn't feel amazed by all the achievements he got. Why does he tell it? He only tells people about his achievements to show off, pretending he's a great person! He is happily and arrogantly seated on a bench telling his life to whoever sits next to him. I didn't care what he said, because he only driveled.After the disappointing climax comes the original ending, which I enjoyed because it wasn't predictable. I never thought Forrest's wife would die. She was sick but I didn't like the way she died. It seems that the writers didn't have anything interesting to add, other than a simple disease to get her out of the story. I also liked it when Forrest and his wife had a child whom they also named Forrest, but I thought the final scene where the child gets onto a bus is interesting because it's somewhat unpredictable; it looked like the whole story would begin again and I do not want to see the same insipid story again because I already went through Gump's life. I certainly do not want to go through his son's life. That'd be more grief!I do not understand why it received an academy award for best picture. I haven't seen many of 1994's movies, but I'm sure there are more inspiring and interesting movies than this one. A good example would be `Shawshank Redempion' that unbelievably lost the Oscar for best picture!Overall, this movie is not outstanding. There are many unnecessary and long scenes such as his life in the army, his life as a rich person his life as a person who waits for a bus and finally his life as a runner. I'm sure this could have been a shorter movie. If it had been this way it wouldn't be so annoying. I found the movie far-fetched because I don't think people can run as much as he did, and I don't think people can be so successful without working hard for their future. When do we see Forrest willing to be a successful person? He only did what his family and girlfriend told him to do. He was never willing to be a successful person. I know it's just a movie so I don't worry about it. All the performances in this movie were somewhat believable, especially Sally Field who was an excellent loving mother. I felt sad when she died, since her character was very caring to her son, as some mothers are to their children. Sally Field's performance was convincing, but I didn't find Tom Hanks deserving of an academy award, because he gave an unbelievably simple and unchallenging performance. His performance in 'The Green Mile' was better. 5/10"
24 February 2016,One of the best cinematic works of our time,,"Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?"
2 September 2001,A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.,,"Once again, I watched ""Forrest Gump"" for Christmas. While it isn't a ""Christmas Movie"", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine.Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way ""A Wonderful Life"" has become a classic."
1 April 2002,Few thoughts,,"Even this movie is old by any standard i have seen it for the first time only today. And when i logged in to see user comments i wasn't surprised to see divided user opinions. This movie can be interpreted differently and provoking in general. Forest Gump by Robert Zemeckis can be movie about anything you want. It can be movie about American History at galnce, Vietnam or about not too bright guy named Forrest Gump who gets lucky. He survives in Vietnam, make a few millions, etc... although i was surprised that amongst nearly 100 comments i have read. I havent' seen anyone who would define a film storyline as a lovestory, not as american history at glance with offensive characters painted by stupid Forrest Gump and his black best friend, who is not so bright too and speak about his shrimp business all the time. A love story of two strong personalities, who live their life through their mistakes to surrender to what was set long time ago."
25 July 2012,"Shawshank Robbed, but this is Great",,"I'd say this is a 94/100 type movie, it sticks in my mind as something that don't forget easily.Tom Hanks is brilliant in this film, as his portrayal of somebody who just isn't too bright is spot on. There are also several lines in this movie that are classics- in particular the ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" line.I don't think it's a particularly deep film for the most part at first, because the story is quite simple. But simple stories can and are often times quite deep- take Aesop's fables for example.It's a shame that in the back of my mind that I have to compare this to Shawshank, because that's my favorite movie and they both came out the same year."
1 April 2002,"Simple, basic, and true",,"I just recently saw this movie again, hadn't seen it since it first came out in '94.  Maybe everyone else figured it out, but I suddenly realized  that the whole movie really was about ""stupid is as stupid does,"" the phrase he repeats every time he's accused of being dim.  Forrest Gump is obviously not a bright guy, but the movie seems to say that that doesn't matter very much because he makes the right choices.  His decisions are smart even if he isn't.And his decisions are, of course, strangely conservative, strange insofar as the movie comes out of ultraliberal Hollywood.  He plays sports, has an old fashioned sense of chivalry (i.e. beating up anyone who abuses his lifelong love Jenny), he goes to war, he believes in God, starts up a small business, works hard, loves his mother, has a deep sense of honor (giving over half the proceeds of ""Bubba Gump"" to the family of his deceased friend) and, strangest of all, is a white male from the south portrayed in a positive light.Contrapose this with Jenny, who is obviously very bright, very smart and makes every wrong move one could make (""stupid is as stupid does"" again comes to mind).  She's promiscuous, a drug user, suicidal, falls in with the anti-war inanity of the SDS and Black Panthers, parties hard at discos during the seventies, and ultimately ends up dying of AIDS, never mentioned, but the implication is of course there.The movie is a tour through American history of course, but I don't think the special effects detract from the basic simplicity of the story.  It is basically a morality story.  Not a very deep or complex one, but just very simple--do the right things, and your life will turn out okay.There aren't very many of these movies made anymore, and so it's somewhat satisfying that this one was, and that it was so successful. It's as if American society had finally had its fill of beautiful alienated youngsters who rebel, do drugs, hate their parents and act like all around jerks (see American Beauty or Cruel Intentions for examples).Gump isn't the best movie ever made, but it's a strong one, one very much worth seeing, and seeing again to be honest.  ""Stupid is as stupid does"" may not be poetry or very deep, but it ends up being true, and more than enough to fill up a movie, and make you feel good as the feather floats up into the air at the end."
16 April 2000,WHERE'S JIMMY?,,"'Forrest Gump' was an inoffensive and entertaining enough movie without being spectacular cinema. However, my comments concern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the moviePresident Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of Nixon.There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a dubious proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think there's any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable landscape"
25 April 2016,the movie forrest gump,,"forrest gump is a great movie. the he tells his life story. sally fields did a great great job standing up for her son. she always told him life was like a box of chocolates you never know what your going to get. jenny tells to run forrest run. they were like peas and carrots, he join the army was so funny , and benjamin telling forrest all about shrimping. and when he tried to save benjamin but dies any way. forrest boat for shrimping was great he took on the captain .but my favorite part is when he found out jenny has had his son . and jenny and he got married . cried when jenny dyed. and how he when he go out every day to tell her about what little forrest did that day. and putting on the bus he tells the bus drive not support to talks to strangers then he tell her his name and gets on the bus i cried. greatest movie of all time"
16 September 2004,Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film,,"FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell.Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write ""Imagine"" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie. What happened to Robert Zemeckis? This is the guy who gave us USED CARS, ROMANCING THE STONE, BACK TO THE FUTURE and WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT.I liked you a lot more before you sold your soul, Bob."
2 December 2001,Disappointing is the very least I can say,,"I was chided for not having seen this film...now I can chide back. I really shouldn't be writing about it since I DID NOT see the whole thing. Yes, I had to turn the DVD off after an agonizing hour. What a ""cute"" movie, but that's all it is. And to think academy voters chose this stupid, egotistic film over Shawshank Redemption. It's a sign that Hanks has way too much academy pull. Great actor but the film comes up short. Don't be chided into renting this thing."
18 November 2002,"The film is like a box of chocolates, the further you get the sicker you feel",,"There's something really nasty at the heart of this movie which makes my skin crawl. It's the story of a simple-minded retard unquestioningly accepting the word of all authority figures in his life. He winds up a multi-millionaire living in a huge mansion and adored by all. His girlfriend Jenny, on the other hand, is an intelligent young girl who is abused by her father. She leaves home for college and tries to make her own way in life, ending up with a violent partner, addicted to drugs and dying of AIDS. No amount of gloss could render such message palatable. Utter garbage."
14 September 2012,Thank you,,"Through out the movie I was crying like a child... LiterallyI feel like there is too many things in this world I cannot solve...And to silly, stupid Forrest everything is simple and he don't want to solve.Love, integrity, courage and what all qualities a person can possibly have comes out of a silly person named Forrest Gump.I don't know how to rate this movie, it would be a sin if I compare this Forrest Gump with any other, and it sure touches my heart, I never experienced this way before.Thank you Robert Zemeckis"
5 May 2016,Forest Gump Review,,"Forest Gump ReviewForest Gump is always running away from danger, bullies, football, and sometimes just because. Running helps face many ups and downs in his life. As the protagonist trying to find love he can't get it because the love of his life can't see past his simple mind until it's too late. While Forest is achieving great success in his life by becoming a football star, a army hero, a ping pong champion, a shrimp boat captain, and a nationally known runner, he still wants Jenny. The film was produced in 1994 by Paramount Studios and Steve Tisch, Steve Starkey, Wendy Finerman. Forest who is born simple in Alabama during the period of segregation in our country and he has many obstacles as a child because people refer him as stupid, but his mother tells him he is not and to not to listen to them. He also has to have ""magic legs"" to help walk better, and he learns at an early age that he can run anywhere faster than he can walk. The movie moves thru history as Forest ages, and takes him to Vietnam and many other great adventures. He finds a lifelong friend along the way in his army Lieutenant, and Forest is always thinking about Jenny his childhood friend, wishing to be with her.The effects set the mood of each scenes and capture the times especially during the war scenes with the music and the sounds of violence. The songs played in each time sequence of the movie help you establish what period Forest is in.The theme is you never know what you are going to get in life and you will never be prepared so you need to make the best of everything. Hope that along the way that best always happens and try not to get off track. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies that I have seen. It's got a good story, good music, and you the message is one that everyone should try for. I rate this movie a 10 out of a 10."
24 August 1999,Dumb and dumbest,,"In the early 90s Michael Medved wrote a book urging Hollywood to eschew sex and violence and make films that extolled the virtues of America, family, religion, apple pie, Thanksgiving, home-baked cookies blah blah blah. He was arguing from a 'moral' (read 'conventional Western family-oriented' standpoint) but his argument also had a bearing on the bottom line. He reckoned that more 'nice' films would encourage more people back into the cinemas.Forrest Gump would appear to be the realisation of Medved's dream, to the extent that the movie also praises the virtue he left off the list, namely abject stupidity.Because that's what MM and his cronies really want, isn't it? Movies that don't challenge, don't irritate, don't ask awkward questions. Movies with no toilets (see Pleasantville), movies that operate on the assumption that a fortune-cookie-spouting dullard who loves his mom is some kind of embodiment of the American dream.Wake up, America. You managed to elect one Hollywood simpleton with a tenuous acquaintance to reality. Now you make movies about them. In the words of the greatest American philosopher, D'OH!This is a dumb movie, made by clever, cynical people, for other people who want to feel all warm and fuzzy and not worry about the fact that they lost all form of intellectual discrimination the day they took out that subscription to Reader's Digest. It sucks like an industrial vacuum cleaner on amphetamine sulphate. Yuk."
13 July 2004,Gomer Pyle meets Rudy...,,"It doesn't really surprise me that so many people think Forrest Gump is a great film... it only reconfirms my feelings about the average filmgoer. Simply a poor man's Zelig (that's another film for those who don't know) that's been dumbed down to reach the television audience. Anyone who really believes that ""Life's like a box of chocolates..."" is too naive to even be reached...yeah, life's like a box of chocolates if some of the selections were confections and some excrement. Don't mean to sound bitter but live a half century (with your eyes open!) and see if you don't agree...by the way what type of chocolate did it taste like to you when you saw the world trade center collapse? Gump is Gomer Pyle who can't sing...and before you rush to defend...it's been 10 years and what were Zemeckis' other great films?"
8 September 1998,You Should See It Twice,,"I went to this movie expecting something spectacular. I left the theatre thinking to myself ""what the heck was so special about that?"" When it came out on video I decided to buy it because it was racking up so many awards. The second time was much better than the first. I forgot about the hype, I just watched it and enjoyed it with my family. It is a great movie. Funny at times, yet extremely sad at times also. It makes you think about life, it makes you want to be like Forrest. Tom Hanks is great, as is Gary Sinise , Sally Field, and the character Bubba is one of the all-time great supporting characters. I have seen it at least 10 times now. My rating: 9 out of 10."
3 August 1998,Like a box of chocolates,,"A much more likable character than the one in the original novel, Forrest takes us on a surreal tour of every major event in the period during the birth of the civil rights movement and the anti-war era. He is so simple, open, and direct, that the audience can't help but like him. The film is at various times funny, sad, exciting, and moving. Tom Hanks so personified this modern Huck Finn that he well deserved his second Oscar."
11 December 2006,watch it to enjoy it,,"hm I'm a little shocked at the level of hatred for this film. I've seen it at least half a dozen times, and every time i cannot help but be touched.i think a lot of people are taking it far too seriously.i don't think this film is about all the events featured in it, its not about the moral implications of war, about the right and wrong way to live life, i don't even think its all that much about the ""american dream"" this film is about the way a simple minded innocent man LIVES through these experiences, its about his VIEWS on life.i think its really sad that people can watch this film and completely miss what makes it so moving. if u watch this film as a walk-through of the life of an extremely likable character, if u see it as he sees things, you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie experience. if your going to watch it to pick faults in the personality and views presented then you will undoubtedly find a lot to complain about.its a story about how one individual handles the situations that life throws at him. it is what makes this film so charming."
5 July 2003,A Great Document of the Second Half of the Century,,"This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my lifetime.  Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS.  This film is a very touching document of the second half of the 20th century and rightly deserves to be praised not just for the technical achievements, but for the wonderful and heartwarming story it is."
10 May 2014,Reviewing the best movie ever,,"I've watched many movies. And it would be really inappropriate to say this isn't the best movie ever. There have been some complaints about movie being too sentimental, but no. This movie is not too sentimental. It is an unforgettable ride, a story following the life of... well, you read the description. All I can say that this is one movie which gets more exciting every minute, leaving you questioning what will happen to Forrest Gump, brilliantly played by Tom Hanks in the role of a lifetime, in the next scene. The movie feature a lot of unforgettable characters and Zemeckis' directing is awesome. It's a movie that really set the bar for every drama that will be filmed in the future."
24 March 2002,The problem with trying to fit a movie into a type-slot,,"I know many people who have gone to see movies and fail to grasp what is certainly the underlying subtleties the writers, producers and actors are trying to convey. I read the derisive comments on this movie and realize the impossibility of helping these people see what they are blind to. They look at 'Forrest Gump' and think ""a movie about a guy who was not too bright and stumbled through life with great luck"", they watch 'A Field of Dreams' and think it is a movie about baseball..... <<SIGH>> Some of us just have to be smacked in the head with it I guess. And please, don't think I subscribe to the new-age physco-babble sensitivity training induced brain-damaged politically-corrected point of view. Gump, and movies such as it, are not meant to be pulled apart scene-by-scene. They are works in full and as such can only be truly understood when viewed as that. Works that try to show lifes experiences and the journey that is life are often hard to tolerate, much less understand if we become so hardened and cynical the we see only the entertainment value in them. It is like going to the La Boheme and seeing only a sad story about poor people, or going to see a Ballet and remembering only that you saw some people dancing about. I you get it, nobody need explain it to you, if you do not get it, no amount of explanation will ever make it clear."
5 January 2001,Reactionary horse manure,,"Politically, 'Forrest Gump' is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing, a deeply reactionary film that valorizes stupidity as akin to some sort of transcendental innocence. As embodied in the figure of the good-hearted simpleton, Forrest Gump (played by the ever-smarmy Tom Hanks), this movie encourages its audience to embrace quietism and noninvolvement as the best means to cope with modernity's horrors. Everyone involved with this monster should be ashamed of themselves. Ditto for the geniuses who showered this piece of dreck with honors. Worst irony of all: this awful film beat out the superb 'Shawshank Redemption' for Best Picture! Yikes!"
24 November 1999,Overly sentimental and a terrible message,,The film is not a great as many people would have us believe.  The film is in fact just an excuse to absolve the entire baby boomer generation.  I also think that the film teaches us to never defy authority.  Think about Forrest never questions and he succeeds as a result.  The film is at best an over glorified retard film.  It is merely a decent film that attempts greatness. Its enormous popularity is another example of the people being doped into a waste of time.  The film is a technical masterpiece and I think it deserves some credit.  I can appreciate the packaging but not what is inside.
4 January 2002,One of the best films to watch.,,"Tom Hanks plays a mild retarded man, who overcomes his handicap by sheer will to live a normal life. Sally Field plays his mother who wants the best for her son. The performances are excellent in the film, no wonder Forrest Gump won six Oscars including best actor for Hanks."
24 November 2004,Through the eyes of a simple-minded man...,,"This is absolutely the best movie Tom Hanks has ever played. Here's a man who low of intelligence, but high on life himself. He may have been simple, but he wasn't narrow-minded which was the bright spot for ""Forrest Gump"". The three important people in his life come and gone: Jenny, Forrest's friend from school, Bubba, an army buddy who lost his life during the war, and his mom, a big impact to him. This movie had a big cast, and the scenes are unforgettable. From the running scene which Jenny shouts: ""Run Forrest, RUN!"" To the all-girls college dorm room scene which I always shudder at. Forrest Gump may not have had a lot of smarts, but he made a lot of difference to himself which he care less to take notice of.This move is a true classic. I've enjoyed every bit of it! 10++! 5 STARS!"
26 January 1999,No respect,,"This movie hit you over head, not trusting viewers to pick up anything. Example flashlights, Washington D.C., early seventies; not enough, must screen down to see Watertgate Hotel sign.Found movie to be tedious and very UNclever.Extremely disappointed."
15 February 2019,I couldn't stand this movie!,,I TOTALLY don't get why people like this movie. I thought the acting was horrible and overall the movie was horrible and ridiculous.They say the worst thing an actor can do is take a part of someone with a developmental disability because it is so difficult to get right. Dustin Hoffman. Yes. Tom Hanks. NO.I love Tom Hanks and all his other movies. This one was an absolute failure.
20 May 2004,Definitely A Masterpiece -- Albeit I Have Mixed Feelings,,"Alright, so, the movie was quite a touching story of a mentally disabled man telling his life story at a bus stop to whoever will sit next to him and listen. I guess, in a way, it goes to show that life can be full or surprises, in many ways.But, the thing I don't think I liked very much about the movie was the way it seemed like Forest had nothing but blind luck all of his life. I mean, it was to the point of being comical. I only ""wish"" I had a life filled with the blind luck like Forest seemed to suffer from, as I am sure many other people do.But -- one thing remains true -- and it was said many times thru the movie and has become an icon for all to remember the movie by --- life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."
25 August 2001,Story of Lovable Forrest in the world full of imperfections and selfishness,,"Dear Friends , I read all of these comments on Forrest Gump. I respect all these views . As for my opinion I think I have never seen anything like that. This was a perfect masterpiece. It would be very unjustified if I praise the movie as its virtue needs no mention. I would rather take up the criticisms expressed. First, Tom Hanks played Gump too brilliantly. Many think that playing Psycho or fool is simple. It is not. Forrest is not stupid. He is just not a ''SMART MAN'' as he himself knows. Gump is an innocent Simpleton. None but Hanks could have done the justice to this character. Second , it is not celebration of stupidity. It is depiction of our imperfect world through the eyes and mind of Forrest. Everyone around him is imperfect ,especially Jenny (we will come to her later). Forrest is the master of his own time and fate.It would be very wrong to find didactic messages in the movie. It is a work of art and should be savored and enjoyed instead of being analyzed. There are some unbelievable episodes and incidents...But why should we murder the beauty only to dissect and analyze ??? Call such parts as Celluloid licenses. This is the movie that makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Forrest's quotes such as , ''Life is a box of chocolates..'' should not be put under scrutiny like quotes from Shakespeare or T.S. Elliot !! He himself says that his mum always tells him things the way he understands them...Now we come to Jenny. She does not have to be goddess. She is one of many imperfect persons showed in the movie. She does love Forrest but is embarrassed and reluctant to share her life with him. She keeps on telling him that she has a life very different from his. Any person in Jenny's place would have done the same. But she has always loved him from childhood to adulthood. In the end when she meets Forrest with a kid and a most Possibly AIDS ,She assures him that she demands nothing from him and can support her child. She is reformed after making mistakes all through her life and learning from them. Maybe she got AIDS after she made love to Forrest and maybe after she gave Birth to Forrest Jr. ? Anyway , this is perhaps the biggest Celluloid license in the movie and we could ignore it.I do not have any particular favorite scenes in the movie as I love the whole movie . But still if I have to mention ....I would say that the last one when Forrest talks to Jenny while she rests in peace in her grave was very touching. Interestingly her Epitaph describes her as the Wife and mother of Forrest Gump, Which is very sweet and touching and true. And Forrest again made me cry when he shows Jenny a letter from Forrest Junior but moments later he made me laugh when he says that he is not going to read or open it because Junior wanted him not to ! :-) I will always love this movie and this is the story of our own imperfect world in contrast with Forrest's near perfect and most innocent world....almost an Arcadia of its own kind....."
7 March 2003,"That was great, thank you!",,"I've seen this one eleven times. No, it is not my record: I've seen Scooby-Doo fourteen times. But this one was different because it really hit me deep at the very first viewing. And I cried every single time I saw it, which is very unusual of me. I also had a laugh and wondered at the images and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do in this crazy wonderful world. I'm just grateful for this film, for it did me good."
31 August 2002,very great movie,,"I never saw this movie when it came out because I never like popular movies. I finally did see it in 1999, and it was wonderful.  I laughed, I cried, I was just in awe.  Every actor was wonderful.  This movie deserved to be so popular.  18 out of 10 stars."
30 April 2004,Just a brilliant movie with a wonderful performance of Tom Hanks,,"Forrest Gump, wow this movie is amazing and realistic and i absolutely loved it. This movie is so amazing how they put Tom Hanks in the television talking to John F Kennedy, cool. How the elements go through the movie is so amazing and the movie made me cry in the end while Forrest is saying good-bye to his Jenny, oh how sad i actually cried.This movie is a masterpiece and will never be forgotten and I think this is one of Tom Hanks best performance of his career, good for him. The amazing quote is so funny and makes everyone think, everyone's life is definitely a box of chocolate. I really hope people watch this movie seriously and see what an excellent movie this is. Please go see it and you will feel good to be with Forrest Gump4 out of 4 stars a must-see masterpiece"
19 January 2021,Super great!,,The movie was amazing! I really loved how Tom Hanks acted Forrest Gump.
24 February 2024,Forrest Gump,,"""Forrest Gump"" is a heartwarming film that combines elements of drama, comedy, and historical commentary. Its a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The cast led by Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, and Mykelti Williamson. It is a story that celebrates the power of love, friendship, and perseverance, and it reminds us that even the simplest person can make a difference in the world. In the opening scene, Forrest introduces himself to the audience and tells us a little bit about his life. He explains that he is sitting at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, waiting for a bus to take him to Memphis, Tennessee. He also tells us that he has a low IQ, but that his mother always told him that ""life was like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get."" which is one of the MOST iconic phrases I've heard and stayed with me since I was little. Forrest Gump's journey takes him from the American South in the 1950s to the Vietnam War to the halls of power in Washington, D. C. Along the way, he meets and interacts with some of the most iconic figures of the 20th century, including Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon.n Throughout his journey, Forrest remains true to himself, and he maintains his kind and optimistic outlook on life. He is a character who inspires us to be our best selves, even in the face of adversity. ""Forrest Gump"" is a truly special film and one of my favorites that has resonated with audiences for over two decades. The narration in the film ""Forrest Gump"" is one of its most distinctive and memorable elements. The story is told from Forrest's own perspective, and his unique voice and worldview are evident in every word. Forrest is a simple and straightforward storyteller, but his insights into life are profound. He speaks with a kind and optimistic tone, even when recounting difficult experiences. His narration is also full of humor, and he often finds the funny side of even the most serious situations. The film's director, Robert Zemeckis, has said that he wanted the narration to sound ""like Forrest was talking to you over a cup of coffee."" This approach creates a sense of intimacy between Forrest and the audience, and it allows us to connect with him on a personal level. The narration also plays an important role in the film's structure. Forrest's flashbacks are triggered by seemingly random events, such as a feather falling from a tree or a stranger's remark. This gives the film a sense of spontaneity and unpredictability, which mirrors Forrest's own life experiences. The narration is also used to highlight the film's themes of love, friendship, perseverance, and the randomness of life. Forrest's story shows us that even the simplest person can make a difference in the world, and that even the most difficult challenges can be overcome with love and determination."
3 May 2014,My Review Forrest,,"The movie starts off with Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks) at a bus stop telling his life story to all the strangers that sit next to him on the bench. As new strangers sit on the bench with Forrest, we get a different decade of Forrest's' life. Forrest's story starts when he had to wear leg braces as a kid and how the other kids teased him and bullied him, but Forrest's mother Mrs. Gump (played by Sally Field) tells him that stupid is as stupid does. Those words help Forrest to tolerate the bullies. Forrest's mother is determined to enroll Forrest in a regular school but she is told that his IQ is below the learning level and a special school would be more appropriate. Instead of listening to the school officials, she enrolls him a regular school against the odds and his first day of school he meets Jenny Curran (played by Robin Wright) and falls madly in love with her. As Forrest would say, ""Jenny and I are like peas and carrots."" Forrest had two special friends that he met in the military, Benjamin Buford ""Bubba"" Blue (played by Mykelti Williamson) and Second Lieutenant Dan Taylor (played by Gary Sinise). Forrest also finds out he has a son Forrest Gump Jr. (played by Haley Joel Osment) that he later raises.There are several themes in Forrest Gump. The first theme would be dealing with death and that death is a part of life and we all have to deal with it. Forrest had to deal with the death of his good friend Bubba, his mother, and Jenny. Another theme is not to give up. Forrest deals with so many obstacles throughout his life and by him being mentality and physically challenged, but he always pulls through those challenges by remembering things his other taught him. Forrest dealt with the legs braces and being bullied by other kids and he dealt with the rejection from Jenny not wanting be his girlfriend or to marry him. The last theme would be accepting yourself for who you are and value your own personal worth despite the odds. Forrest's mother taught him to love, always be pleasant and polite and to remember that life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. The movie Radio would be similar to Forest Gump. Radio (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) deals with similarities as far as being raised by a single mother, dealing with death, along with physical and mental disabilities.The lighting in the movie for the themes was very appropriate, for example when Forrest spoke with his mother the day before her passing the lighting had a serenity essence almost as if to state Mrs. Gump would have eternal life in heaven. When Forrest's lost his very best buddy Bubba, the lighting was dark and gloomy, but I'm sure that was due to the two being in the middle of a war. If you pay close attention the lighting changes when Forrest takes pride in himself and practically referring to the part when Forrest is asked to mow and service the lawn at the university he attended. He was mighty proud.Forrest Gump was raised with values and morals and the movie portrays those values and morals, but it also makes a statement how America needs to embrace those values and morals."
23 March 2018,Give it a try,,"If you never saw the movie give it a try. 
I thought it's a no brainer 10/10"
24 February 2003,Hey Gump!,,Check this movie out! It is a film that sends a great message to its audience. It really is about a person who just lives their life as they know best and deals with the outside world with ease. It is never easy to go out and try to please others and make them feel better about themselves than it is just to be who you are and know that the greatest asset one has is themselves. Take the time to get out and get this movie watch it and look for its message. One should be advised that it has a book that you can check out at your local library and remember that it is a movie it may not contain every little detail there is in the book but it still has a great message. Best of luck to you who wants to see this film.
4 March 2019,Best Movie Ever,,I loved watching this movie back when I was younger and I love how it inspires others to take chances to do what they can't.. honestly amazing.
18 May 2002,The South's greatest hero since Huck Finn,,"Some moral high grounders were up in arms over this film because of the depictions of sex, violence, drugs etc in it. Yes, the sleazy side of life features heavily in Forrest Gump but the film laughs at it. The film does not make out that there's anything admirable about sexual perversion, violence, heavy drinking or drug taking. Forrest always knows the right things to say and do and although he might not be too bright he is a better person than many of the people he encounters. He shuns the sleazy side of life (although in some ways he doesn't fully understand it) and this is symbolised in the scene when he pushes the hooker away when she tries to make love to him. Jenny poses for Playboy, plays the guitar naked in a perverts' club, takes drugs but Forrest is there for her as her gallant protector and moral guardian. Forrest is also only violent under extreme provocation such as in the scene with Wesley. Wesley sees Forrest in his army uniform and calls him a baby-killer but like many holier-than-thou pacifists Wesley is at heart a violent person who hits Jenny. Forrest duly lays into him and if this scene is violent it's no worse than the handsome hero in an old silent film giving the villain a good thrashing for what he's done to the heroine. Forrest is pleasant to everyone, be they people on the street or US Presidents. He speaks sadly about President Kennedy and John Lennon being shot. Also, he is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour not for killing or destroying the enemy in Vietnam but for saving the lives of other soldiers at great personal risk to himself. He is a decent guy who is successful in life and the film is not patronising to handicapped people as some people have said. The portrayal of the single parent family has also been criticised but frankly the message here is ""always be nice to your Momma"". It is a feel good movie and although life from the 60s to the 80s may not always have been great this film show it in a positive light. Some scenes remind you of Midnight Cowboy and I think this is intentional. However Midnight Cowboy was a downbeat movie made at the end of the cynical 60s. This is a pleasant upbeat film. It is incidentally very different from Winston Groom's book and I think it is better than the book. The only thing I would have changed about the film  is that I wouldn't have had Jenny die at the end. To conclude, funny, heartwarming, original and brilliant."
21 October 2011,Ties with Shawshank as my all-time favorite movie,,"I was very shocked to see this movie only has an 8.3 out of 10.There is sooo much going on in this movie...The best thing about this movie, is that Forrest ""always did the right thing, no matter what cost."" People in the movie made fun of him for being ""stupid"" yet we as a society seem to reward/idolize people who are cunning who often do bad things. When Forrest had to go back into a jungle that was being blown up, he didn't even think about whether it was a good thing to do for his own safety, he just did it. He always stuck up for Jenny when someone was hurting her in any way; again he didn't hesitate, he just did what he felt in his heart was the right thing to do.The other thing is, all the historical parts of this movie. So many pieces of American History were visited! That alone was worth watching. Working Elvis into it was really funny, as was the part where he gets shot.I also loved the music, almost every song in the movie was perfectly-fit for the scene it was in.The acting, obviously, was superb... Gary Sinese was a breakout role IMHO. Loved him in this.What an amazing, epic movie. IMHO, this was 100x better than the Godfather, or Gone with the Wind, which often gets rated much higher. Forrest Gump was simple and pure, a timeless movie no person should go without watching.-Tracy Milburn"

5 March 2001,"A brilliant, but misunderstood movie",,"I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century, complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman. That, along with everything I have already mentioned, makes this a brilliant and wonderful film. If you have never thought of this before, try watching the film with this theory in mind. I promise you'll see it in a different way."
6 August 2011,"A well written, well acted, and well directed masterpiece with a great message",,"Rating: 9.5 /10Teenagers often wonder which roads will bring them to success in life. Should I do what I am told to do? Or should I do what I want to do? Forrest Gump has the answer. Forrest Gump won Oscars awards for Best Picture, Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best director(Robert Zemeckis), Film Editing, Visual Effects and Adapted Screenplay, winning over its competition, Pulp Fiction, in every category. What makes this masterpiece so successful?Forrest Gump has it all: entertainment, comedy, and drama. It is both serious and funny, entertaining but thought provoking, powerful yet charming, and it could make you laugh and cry with equal degree of ease. Forrest Gump touches every human's emotions and inspires everyone in different ways.Robert Zemeckis, known as the undisputed master of film technology, puts Winston Groom's novel to screen. He creates a masterpiece that combines the beauty of special effects and storytelling together. Adapted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Eric Roth, This film follows the journey of a not-so-smart man Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) through 30 years of trails and tribulation, placing Forrest within historical moments of history. How does he do it? He simply does whatever he is told and goes wherever the wind blows him. As Forrest would say ""Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you are gonna get"" However, The audience can hardly say that Forrest Gump is just an idiot who does whatever he is told to do. In fact, in his innocence, he does what he feels he has to do, no matter the situations and people around him, guided only by his inner sense of right and wrong.Throughout the journey of Forrest Gump, he meets different interesting people who are each valued very highly by Forrest. His mom, played by Sally Field, fought for his son in every way possible despite the fact that he is gifted with an IQ of just 75 and Jenny (Robin Wright), the love of Forrest's life, whom he met at school. There is also Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), Forrest's Vietnam War friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day, and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) Forrest's lieutenant during his military service.Robert Zemeckis uses the techniques of characterization and symbolization to express the message of Forrest Gump. The main characters in this film represent different types of people in our society. They are all different in terms of how they live their lives and travel towards their destinies. Forrest is the feather, floating in the air, with no direct route or known destination whatsoever. Jenny is more like the birds; she chooses her path with more awareness. While Lt. Dan is represented by legs, shoes, and roads; he knows what he is destined to do in life.Robert Zemeckis, the director of the Back To The Future trilogy, once again accomplishes what he knows best: Special effects. The film covers a brief history of America for over a period of 30 years. Bringing this film credibility is the ability to place Forrest in history making events. These events range from Forrest teaching Elvis how to swing his hips to meeting Presidents for various accomplishments. These television clips are terrifically and creatively done in black and white by Zemeckis considering this is a 1996 film when Special effects haven't developed as much as they are today.The camera work in this film is very beautifully done balancing a variety of camera techniques. For most of the film, the movie seems slow paced by the way camera work is done. The camera is kept very still but somewhat poetic and moves slowly as the film carries on. It symbolizes the calmness of Forrest's life that is always changing and moving along until he reaches his destiny. However, when the film calls for action, the camera shots do not disappoint. The shaky camera and close-ups showing the characters' emotions work well during action sequences. At one point in Forrest's life where he travels to many different places, Zemickis uses establishing shots to show all the different settings that take place in this film.The actors' success in portraying their characters is a major factor in the film's awards. The on-screen chemistry between Tom Hanks and Robin Wright was phenomenal. Tom Hanks brings Forrest Gump into life and gives one of the best performances in his career. Gary Sinise is convincing as a man who is cheated by his own destiny. Eric Roth deservingly won Oscar for the beautiful screenplay he wrote which belongs in the company of sweet classics such as Rain man and Harvey. Forrest Gump could also be appreciated as a classic version of The curious case of Benjamin Button which has similar theme and message. Certainly, Forrest Gump deserves its place with all the classics in Film History.The message of Forrest Gump is a life-changing advice for teenagers who are struggling with their lives out in the real world. Forrest Gump offers them a simple but straight-to-the-point advice. It doesn't matter who we are or what we do; whether we are stupid or smart, rich or poor, black or white. Forrest teaches us to do everything with the best of our abilities. Forrest is an ordinary guy like we all are. He is teased and bullied about his stupidity from those around him. But he, with a heart of gold and a low IQ, never gives up. He goes out there, lives his life, and puts effort in everything he does. If only we all do everything with effort, we will one day reach our destinies like Forrest did."
15 March 2024,Forever in my mind and my heart,,"""Forest Gump"" is more than a film; it's a timeless beacon of inspiration. Its titular character, with his pure heart and unwavering determination, touches souls deeply. Through life's twists, he teaches us resilience, kindness, and the beauty of simplicity. Forrest's journey from adversity to triumph resonates with audiences worldwide, reminding us that greatness can come from the unlikeliest of places. His iconic line, ""Life is like a box of chocolates,"" encapsulates the unpredictability of existence and the importance of embracing every moment. ""Forest Gump"" will forever dwell in the chambers of our hearts, a testament to the power of perseverance and the boundless potential within us all."
1 February 2002,A good story,,"The Germans have a word for events that appear to be the result of a joke played by fate or history.  It is called treppenwitz.  I don't know if the filmmakers were aware of this word, but they sure knew how to use the spirit of it.  Treppenwitz pervades the many vicissitudes of the title character as his naiveté impels him not only through his own life, but also through many critical moments in history.  But, where many quirky takes on history dissolve into a one-joke show, `Forrest Gump' endears us, because of the touching nature of its simple protagonist.  As the story slips in and out of historical tableaus we focus not on the famous persons, but on Forrest, because only one as credulous as he could examine these happening impartially.Forrest could have been annoying, with his inane likeability and sententiousness.  But we realize that while we condescend to the verities that Forrest espouses, he is uncynical enough to find the implicit truth within them.  His simple nature is easy to admire, and perhaps even envy. Though only anecdotal, I have noticed that people who are concerned with the simpler aspects of life seem generally happier than others.  His credulousness serves as a sort of aloofness over many of life's drearier aspects.The bottom line is that I simply like films like this; low-key epics with the right mix of comedy, drama, and bits of history thrown in.  I'm not a big special effects buff, but here they are relevant in putting Forrest in the past, so I appreciate the work, and once more sing the praises of the magic of Hollywood."
26 August 2000,deserved every award it got,,"Simply amazing.  Let me start out my saying Tom Hanks was incredible as the title role, and he deserved the Oscar more than anyone else.  Good job Tom! Also, the historical aspects, thought, special effects, music, direction, and emotions brought to the screen were very well done.  A lot of people don't like this.  I wonder why.  They are probably the same crowd who thought American Beauty sucked, so, obviously, they wouldn't know a good movie if it kicked them in their dumb-asses.  Maybe Forrest Gump's accent or stupidity brought it down for them.  Maybe they are prejudice against mentally-challenged people, if so, shame on them.  But anyway, great movie....one of the best.......ever."
9 February 2017,Forrest Gump- timeless classic,,"Directed by Robert Zemekis, Forrest Gump is an endearing story of the trials and victories of Forrest (played by Tom Hanks) from the time he was a boy through adulthood, and an all-time fantastic movie. We see the challenges of being bullied as a young boy for being ""different"" from his peers, and we see how Forrest's mom (Sally Field) is his biggest cheerleader. We watch as he gets his one and only friend Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and see their relationship blossom over the years. Forrest and Jenny ""are best good friends"" and are there for each other through all phases and stages of life. The layering of visible and invisible sound allows the viewer to actually feel as if they are present in the film. The use of creative editing makes the appearance that Forrest Gump is present for many of history's meaningful moments including the Vietnam War, being in the presence of President Nixon, President Kennedy, among other events. Tom Hanks' performance as Forrest Gump is one that will go down in the history books. His wisdom through innocence is what makes the viewer root for Forrest. There is sure to be tears and laughter as we go through Forrest's life experiences and trials alongside him."
14 January 2018,awesome view from life of a man,,A man who had a under 75 iQ and awesome adventure. in beginning movie starts with a feather and it is awesome too. a positive thing about movie is simple man without cheating becomes a millioniare....
23 October 2014,I liked the script because it was a movie different,,"Tonight I fell over in the movie ""Forest Gump"". You probably have seen many of you.I saw her the first time when it came out in cinemas and touched me very very much. Asked one of my favorite movies, perhaps the most beloved.Not because I laughed with smart funny scenes, but because ""he spoke"" for all truly beautiful feelings. Love, friendship, faith, patience, sincerity, selflessness, kindness, generosity, hope. But for children traumatized souls, or how to squander our lives on meaningless things and pleasures and lose the chance to be close to those who love us really.Maybe I liked the script because it was a movie different from all the others and still is. I clever script. I loved the music of the beginning and end titles and interpretations of protagonists.But for many it was just a movie about a retarded. The felt ridiculous because it is ridiculous, such a person can accomplish such things in reality. And for other reasons.You have seen how you?"
25 March 2018,Absolutely Beautiful,,"This movie is a classic, a must-see. It has many lessons and morals wich you can learn from, it shows that perspective is everything. You can either dwell on it, or you can enjoy it. Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna' get (;"
6 August 2011,"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get",,"With this wisdom the movie takes off and Forrest Gump introduces himself. He tells his life story to anyone who wants to hear it. And what a story it is. Although simple-minded, following the advice of his mother and childhood friend Jenny, Forrest gets places. His mother tells him he's the same as everyone else, and no different at all. And she makes sure he goes to a regular school, no matter what it takes. And on the school bus he meets his one and only girlfriend, Jenny. Together they're like peas and carrots. She tells him that whenever he's in trouble, he should run away. And she cheers him shouting 'Run, Forrest, run!'. He can run like the wind blows. It literally takes him anywhere. During his travels, he also meets up with various interesting people and gets involved in American history in the making.Tom Hanks puts up a great performance and definitely pulls it off with flying colors. Robert Zemeckis, is a master of special effects, and uses it very effectively to include Forrest Gump into historical events. In the end, it's a wonderful and inspiring movie. Highly recommended.Rating: PG-13 or 12 (NL)"
1 February 2019,Amazing,,Great movie would totally recommend seen it many times and would continue to watch it more. Great for everyone
31 July 2001,A Special Film,,I think this is one the best films i've seen. I was realy sorry for Forrest in very scenes because of the way that jenny was to him . I agree with the comment that says that she was using him all the long and it made me think that we all are used by someone at least one time in life. I have only one problem with this film and it regards to the oscars because this film beat 2 of my favorite films of all time (pulp fiction and Shawshank Redemption ).
1 March 2024,Forrest Gump,,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally challenged man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough."
9 July 2013,Forrest Gump,,"Forrest Gump Forrest Gump has to be one of the greatest stories ever written. Not only does it have a great plot and love story, but lots of historical context throughout. . It covers, wars, influential people at the time, famous people who have passed away, and how they impacted the world can be tied to the movie It starts' out in the late 50's and moves on through the late 80's, covering most major historical events. The movie starts out by an older Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) sitting at Savannah, GA bus stop telling his life story to the fellow bus riders. Some are very attentive, some indifferent and some are simply in disbelief listening to the stranger tell them of his accomplishments, even though he doesn't view them that way. Forrest, a kind and faithful soul, grew up in Greenbow, Alabama in the early 60's, he has a low I.Q., which leaves him very prejudiced with the schools and other residents of his town. Along with the low I.Q., he has leg braces for most of his early childhood leaving people to believe he was going to be crippled for life.His mother( Sally Field) teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to create his own destiny, despite the challenges she knew he would face because of his mentally capacity. He doesn't have any friends except a young girl named Jenny Curran (Robin Wright), whom he loves from the second he lays eyes on her. Forrest and Jenny get into a altercation with a group of older boys from their school, and he breaks free of legs braces only to reveal that he is lightning fast, which leads to a college scholarship. Forrest and Jenny were inseparable until Jenny decides to run away from her abusive father and go travel the United States with a band of hippies.After Jenny left their home town, Forrest enlists in the United States Army, only to be drafted to Vietnam. There he makes friends with a black man named Bubba, and LT. Dan. After many weeks together, Bubba convinces Forrest to open up a shrimping company once they are discharged from the army. Later on the platoon is attacked and Forrest has to run back into the chaos to rescue his fellow friends, Bubba dies from his wounds, and LT. Dan lost his legs, but survives thanks to Forrest. He received the Congressional Medal of Honor from the President. Forrest then goes on to be a famous ping pong champion and ends up winning thousands of dollars to help in invest in his and Bubba's Shrimp Company, Bubba Gump, which then becomes a giant multi-million dollar company.Forrest is asked to speak at the Washington Monument about his life in Vietnam, since he was awarded the Medal of Honor and Jenny happens to be there protesting against the war. They end up going back to Savannah, GA because Forrest's mother is dying of cancer, and she was like the mother Jenny never had. Along his travels Forrest meets, Elvis Presley, John Lennon, John F Kennedy and many more. This movie is very rich historical context, it also is showing the audience that no matter where you started in life, you can always be the best you can be if you just try your hardest. I think this movie should be seen by every generation of young adults, because it's so rich a full of the past that is captured so well in the movie. The historical context just translate so much better than reading it out of a book, because of how the main character and his fellow friends have to deal with the problems of the world. I really loved how even though Forrest is so innocent, you really get a feel of how people in the 60's and 70's felt about segregation, their government, about the Vietnam War, and how the government evolves from the 50's all the way to the 80's. The movie has Forrest walk through the first desegregated school and help a young African-American Woman as she is walking almost what seems like hell on earth for her with screaming white protesters. Forrest also stumbles upon the Watergate scandal and actually calls the police on them. If you get the chance, watch the movie, if you have already seen it, go see it again"
28 April 2003,A unique film for the soft-hearted!,,"Just watched again last Sunday.  I really didn't want to, because I find the film somewhat melancholy, but my girlfriend insisted.  Don't like movies that deal with death and loss all that much.I see a lot of differing opinions about this movie that it was about stupid people from the south, that it's a morality play, that it shows that anyone can succeed.I really don' think that the director wanted to have such a heavy handed obvious movie at all. This movie is like a painting, not a linear story. It was not about the South, Forest Gump, or Vietnam.  It was about life! There were parts of it that were silly, made me laugh, and yeah, tear up (when his mother was sick and dying).So, like every film ever made it has it's flaws and is imperfect.  It will work with some people and not with others.  But I found it to have moments, scenes of mesmerizing beauty that really got to a part of the human soul that a few movies try, but fail to reach."
30 October 2002,the BEST movie!,,"This movie is the best movie ever! It is so touching and you are guaranteed to be left with an excellent feeling after watching it.  Tom Hanks delivers an AMAZING performance, one of his best ever.  He plays Forrest so well. Gary Sinise is scary as always. He did portray Lt. Dan very well. With it's actors and beautiful plot line this movie is one of the best."
6 October 2017,cause of death for jenny,,"In the movie of Forest Gump. Forrest Gump was born on June 6, 1944. Hepatitis C was the cause of jenny's death. Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film. Based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film was directed by Robert Zemeckis. FK, LBJ, Vietnam, Watergate, and other history unfold through the perspective."
14 January 2015,A beautiful fairy tale,,"Once upon a time...This is the feeling I get when I think about Forrest Gump. With a narrator the movie becomes magic. Seeing the world through Forrest Gumps eyes is truly a fairy tale.Overcoming difficulties as a child and growing strong from it. Seeing the world. Meeting famous people like presidents, rock stars and other celebrities. Starting a big company that take the world by storm.The actors are fantastic. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Forrest Gump. Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor is really hard-boiled. Sally Field and Robin Wright are a delight. Remember whatever happens in your life just go out and run, just run and everything will feel better."
8 July 2001,"Simply a ""Either you buy it, or you don't"" movie.",,"Forrest Gump is simply a ""Either you Buy it, or you don't"" movie. I bought it, because the movie is just so endlessly charming to me. Every scene is magical. And it just gets better and better as it goes along. The movie has everything, drama, comedy, adventure, war, etc. The soundtrack is great. Tom Hanks is magnificent also. Overall, Forrest Gump is endlessly charming and one of my  personal favorite movies. **** (out of four)"
7 June 2002,i liked this film,,"I saw this film this morning and i found it very pleasant. I didn't know this film before and I think that throughout the years this film hasn't lost his qualities. And as other people said, it easily warms your heart."
27 December 2010,Forrest Gump,,"Forrest Gump is a 1994 American film based on a novel by Winston Groom ,the genre of film is comedy Drama and Robert Zemeckis is the director of film. The main actors are Tom Hanks ,Robin Wright and Gary Sinisie .the film was nominated for thirteen Oscars and swept six of them including ,best leading actor Tom Hanks, best director ,best film editing ,best picture, best visual effects and best adapted screenplay. The film in box office could take near $ 700, 000,000 worldwide. The film is production of Paramount pictures. Summary and plot A man with low IQ waiting in a bus station tells his life story to a women sitting near him. he recounts all events in his life , about his mother ,his military service ,being sent to Vietnam ,saving his commander 's life and coming back home like a hero ,he remembers visiting some presidents of the US ,and getting rich in shrimping industry. he finds his lost love , jenny but he is too stupid to understand the importance of his action in his life. Making films about retarded people is not a new case, at least we have three movies which theirs heroes are people with problem in IQ Forrest Gump, Rain Man and I am Sam .the common fact about three films starring success to taking awards. the director Robert Zemeckis made one on of the his best films in his career and tom Hanks played one of the most praised acting in the world. Forrest joins to the army randomly and without seeking to be hero becomes a national hero similarly when he plays ping pong he doesn't have any motives ,we can see this when he goes to university ,In Beijing ,china , Forrest saves Mao from drowning . Forrest Gump has several messages, some of which are less obvious than the others. The most frequently recurring theme is not to give up on life. Why surrender when you don't know what lies ahead? By contrasting Forrest's life with the lives of those around him, and by showing how the passage of time brings solace to even the most embittered hearts, the movie underlines this point. Tom hanks was the only actor who could play this role , after watching the film I can't imagine somebody other than Tom hanks could show this modesty ,outspoken simplicity as he did. The film is the mixture of tragedy and comedy and lots of significant truths are hidden in it. Forrest Gump has lots of memorable quotes for example ""I am not a smart man ,but I know what love is "" or "" stupid is as stupid does "" !"
11 July 2023,Movies are like a box of chocolate: you never know what you're gonna get,,"Forrest Gump,"" despite its immense popularity, is a film that falls short of its acclaim. While the movie's intention may have been to deliver a heartwarming story about an ordinary man's extraordinary journey, it ultimately suffers from a lack of depth and a reliance on sentimentalism. The character of Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks, is portrayed as a simple-minded individual who happens to stumble into numerous historic events, which is an implausible and contrived concept. Moreover, the film's portrayal of historical figures and events feels forced and superficial, reducing them to mere props in Forrest's story rather than exploring their significance in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the movie's attempts to tackle complex social and political issues, such as racism and war, feel shallow and oversimplified, reducing them to mere plot devices rather than engaging in a nuanced exploration. Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" may have its moments of charm, but it ultimately fails to deliver a thought-provoking and substantive cinematic experience."
7 June 2002,sssss,,"Forrest Gumps is a charming film that captivates audiences and wraps you up in a beautiful story about life and the american dream. This movie is the stuff that dreams are made of and the characters easily warm your heart. I would say that this film is certainly an epic and I've always felt it was an emotional rollercoaster. This film is not easily forgotten and has that magic that only so many films have. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances ever in film history. Great special effects, and an incredible soundtrack work together to create the classic that is Forrest Gump."
11 September 2003,A bittersweet love story,,The best of the movie is the bittersweet story of love between Forrest and Jenny. Despite the numerous historical mistakes; a different and lovely film when a moral message: the value of the true friendship.
26 April 2019,A must watch,,It's the kind of movie that will stay relatable and give the same feelings for every new generation.
5 November 2004,Technological miracle,,"What Forrest Gump tells about is a man, named Forrest Gump , who has intelligence as low as going through American past of 40 years. Forrest Gump is the most amazing film I have ever seen. The way the director directs is a miracle. The first scene, i.e., at the beginning of the film, one feather falling down to where Gump is sitting .It looks like a long and continuous moving scene. Even though you gaze at the feather (I ever did it), you could not tell whether it is true .The shade and reflection make it real. I am really confused the way to make the feather authentic. Beside of the technological miracle, the way the story tells is kind of self-reflection: Gump picks up the feather and puts it into a book. During the whole film, the feather has not been taken out any more until the end .So I am convinced easily that it is a comedy as leisurely as a feather. Definitely, the feather is one of highlights. Begin with the falling of the feather, Gump picks up the feather and begins to tell his experience to strangers. Afterward, he stands up and runs to find Jannie and his son. With the possession of the feather, something different from the former relation between Gump and Jannie: they ultimately marry each other and have the short happy time. Jannie dies of a serious disease. However, she leaves prosperity to Gump and his son, i.e., the prosperity for the next generation. The small family is kept after all (it seems to be prosperous). With the present of the feather, at the time when the old Gump sends his son to get on the school bus, the circle is made full and it is the end of the story. What¡¯s more, what I am thrilled is another revolution of directing: Gump is put into the historical events presenting with the historical big names, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, by switching the scenes of the old documentary with Forrest Gump, which is a milestone in film-making history."
11 March 2012,An amazing movie.,,"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man with a low I.Q., but a good outlook on life. He lives through many historical events and always seems to run into his childhood friend/love interest Jenny.Where do I began to start describing this film? Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors, so he did a great job being Forrest. Gary Sinise also did a good job being Lt. Dan. Sally Field did good portraying Mrs. Gump, Forrest's mother. I loved how the movie showed many historical events, just to name a couple: the Vietnam War and the Reagan assassination attempt. Some of the lines were pretty funny and even heartfelt.Another thing I love about this movie is how some of the characters talk about if we all have our own destiny or if we're just floating in a breeze. Something like that always gets me thinking about the life God has given me.Overall, Forrest Gump is an amazing movie that anybody will enjoy and that everyone should see. I watch it whenever it's on T.V."
14 January 2002,The Simplicity is the Best!,,"As you have seen 'Forrest Gump' (1994), you feel great. "" Hey, maybe it's good that everyone are not very wise"", you hear yourself saying. And this movie, 'Forrest Gump', gives you every reason to be happy if you are not as smart as others. At least he did it well! Tom Hanks, like usually, is amazing. He gives Forrest Gump the face no one will ever forget and a soul so nice and loving. His accent is believable and he certainly deserved an Oscar! I'll give it 8 / 10."
17 April 2018,Life lesson movie,,Really love this movie! Have watch it so many times I've learned the words haha
25 July 2002,"Hi, I'm Forrest, Forrest Gump.",,"SPOILERS!! This film is a brilliant tale of a man who passes through a series of historical events, unwittingly, however, while trying to find his true love. What I enjoyed most about this film, though, was the way that Forrest was passing through different events without having a clue what was going on. It is the way Forrest is shown mixing in Black and White with historical figures that gets me laughing always. Forrest's great Grandpa was the man who started the KKK. He taught Elvis how to shake. He broke free of his leg braces to run very fast. Got spotted for college football. Joins the All American team, meets JFK and says ""I gotta Pee!"" Graduates.  Joins the Army. Becomes a Vietnam war hero. Gets the Medal of Honor. Meets the President again. Causes the Watergate Scandal. Becomes a Ping Pong champion, playing in China, and winning! Does a talk show with John Lennon. Becomes a Shrimpin' Tycoon. Becomes a Millionaire. Gets his money invested in ""some fruit company, or something"" (Apple Mac). Gives a lot of money away. Becomes a lawnmower man. Runs across the country non stop. Invents the Smiley face, and its slogan ""Have a Nice Day!"". Invents the phrase ""S**t happens"". Finds his true love, Jenny. Becomes a father. Becomes a widow. Thats a hell of a lot of stuff ,thats why I like this film so much, it has so much to view, and it isn't just the same old boring stuff."
1 September 2014,what we can learn from forrest gump,,"i have seen this movie 20+ and every time i learn something new.we can see the movie as a historic movie but its much more than that, it tells the story of a men with a disability and alt ouch that he has his disability he is overcoming it and is achieving more than the ""normal"" people.i love this movie go watch it show it to your class your kids your grandkids they will learn one thing: stupid is, is stupid does in other words you are not you'r disability.iam deaf and walk with a cane but that is not me i am more than that and this movie has teached me to accept that"
4 March 2003,Narrative voice over is old hat...but I can forgive. GREAT MOVIE,,"It seems that when a story is told on film, the most difficult thing to do is NOT use a narrative voice over. Sometimes film makers get lazy or lack creativity and decide that the viewer would be lost without the narrative, so they feel trapped into adding the story-telling voice over (or even worse, long paragraphs scrolling between each act). It is especially hard to avoid when covering a long time span. While being informative, to me it can dumb a movie down. This is the ONLY complaint I have with this whole movie. Beyond the small annoyance with the voiced over narration, I thought this was a near perfect movie, combining every element of great modern movie making, from beautiful scenery, to comedic genius, to action, to romance, and on to gripping drama. Further, this movie contained a great cast.***************Spoiler Warning*************** My gripe about the narration being voiced over in order to inform the audience is tempered by the creativity which was used to present the narration. It wasn't your typical story telling of an elderly person wisely reflecting on the life he or she had lived, telling the story to the audience as if we were his or her grandchild. The narration was brilliantly inserted as Forrest met different people at the bus stop, giving us even more insight into this man. He is a simple, friendly and interesting man that wants people to know about him and the love and pain he has endured through the years. He didn't even realize the impact his life had on the culture of the past 2 decades.  Or more interestingly, maybe he DID know what he was saying and just PLAYED dumb. After all, stupid is as stupid does.  Maybe Forrest Gump was a genius (as his drill sergeant put it) and just wanted us to think his life was more important than it really was.  Or how about this, maybe his life really did have this huge cultural impact and he was just being modest.  It's incredible when you think about the number of possible explanations as to why Forrest seemed to so quickly spit out the grand story of his life and it's impact on the world without much regard to how important it REALLY was. He seemed to trivialize each major impact his life had on the world while maintaining his focus on his love for Jennie, his mother's wisdom, or his friend Ltnt Dan.  This creativity, along with the layers it brings to Forrest's persona is why I am able to forgive the lazy approach to story telling in the narrative.It was also interesting to me how some holes were closed, but left to the viewers imagination exactly what happened... most notably Jen's disease. Did she die from AIDS? Did she pass it to her son? Just an interesting tidbit, IMO.In summary, this was a near perfect movie. I believe this movie will hold up for years to come and eventually will be considered a classic. I give this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 points.If you like good music (especially 60's and 70's), get this soundtrack. It's the best movie soundtrack made, for my taste anyway."
9 December 2015,Film Review,,"Forrest Gump Film Review Forrest Gump, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time. Staring Tom Hanks the movie takes you through the life of Forrest Gump. As a child Forest was picked on of the leg braces he had to wear. His best friend was a girl by the name of Jenny Curran. Forrest later develops into a college football star for the University of Alabama. After college Forrest enlists in the US Army. While in training he meets another best friend Bubba. Bubba and Forrest are sent to fight in the Vietnam War. They are assigned to First Lieutenant Dan. While out on a patrol the platoon takes heavy fire from Vietnam solders. Both Lieutenant Dan and Bubba are injured during the firefight. Forrest in an act of bravery goes into the jungle time and time again and pulls his injured comrades from danger saving many lives. As a result of is courageous act Forrest is awarded the Medal of Honor. After this Forrest gets a shrimping boat along with Lieutenant Dan. Later Forrest runs into Jenny, he proposes but she turns him down initially but later comes around to the idea. While recovering from his injury sustained at war Forrest becomes a phenomenal ping pong player and competes against China. John Lennon and Forrest appear on a talk show together. John Lennon, after his trip to China was inspired to write the song ""Imagine"". This brings me to the sound track and music through out the film Forrest Gump. Early in the movie Elvis comes to the Gump's guesthouse where he encounters Forrest. Despite having the leg braces on, Forrest is able to move his hips to ""Hound Dog"". The dance moves then become Elvis' signature moves. One track that is featured is ""For What Its Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield. This song is played as Forrest and his platoon travel through Vietnam. This song has also been connected with the Vietnam conflict and the transition to the counter culture in the 60s. Another song in Forrest Gump is ""Free Bird"" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. This song is heard s a Drug addicted Jenny climbs to the ledge of her hotel balcony as if to jump to her death. The famous guitar solo builds as she climbs to the edge the suspense of the scene is matched with the guitar opening up. There are several instances of mise-en-scene, this helps the viewer feel a strong connection with Forrest. Forrest through out the film has a pretty consistent good attitude. However there are some low points through out the movie and the director uses mise-en-scene to capture these emotions. Once when he is struggling in Vietnam after a firefight. Another time when Forrest is running around the country and hits a wall and realizes this isn't what he wants to do anymore. During happier moments the director uses a low contrast look, which gives a mood of happiness and contentment. There is also a presence of shots that help feel emotion for example at the end of the film when Forrest is looking down at Jenny's grave. The camera looks at Forrest from a low angle and captures the emotion that Forrest feels for jenny."
15 September 2000,"to err is human, to gump is divine",,"this is gump.  you should need no other reason than that. i first read about this movie in a book called ""The World According to Gump.""  Apparently this movie came out in 1994, but it totally passed me by.  I had never even heard of it until last week when I read that book and saw a copy of gump in my video store.  i watched it, and i thought it was so beautiful.  from vietnam to magic legs, this movie portrays the essence of that wonderfully absurd character we know as gump."
25 January 2001,A Master Creation!,,"I have to say that I have seen Forrest Gump about seven times and it never fails to amuse, move and amaze me as one of the best films of the last 10 years. Tom Hanks is one of the best actors that I have ever seen and his portrayal of the slightly dim but warm hearted Forrest Gump is just one of the many examples of this. The plot is very cleverly interwoven with very memorable historical events making us relate and love the character Gump even more. To say that this film is over-rated is to be blind to the pure genius that is the whole story. If it is such a bad film then why would it have been nominated for so many awards? Why did Tom Hanks win an oscar for it? Finally, why is it repeated on TV all the time with thousands upon millions of viewers tuning in to watch Forest's trials and tribulations, slowly but surely falling in love with his character and watching with disgust at Jenny as she fails to notice this sweet, kind and caring man infront of her and chooses the guys who will only let her down time and time again. When I see that film, I always cry, and call me sentimental if you want I can't help but relate to this poor boy who just wants the simple life without having all these people entwined with him, many presidents, Elvis, Chinese world ping-pong champions and the first ever black people to be allowed in white schools! Even through all this, anyone who has a heart can not fail to be touched by, even though this guy has everything that anyone could ever want, all he wants is Jenny."
6 September 2003,An below average man - an extraordinary life!,,"!!!!!WARNINGS SPOILERS!!!!I have just watched this for perhaps the third or forth time in its entirety and once again found it to be an uplifting experience; I have read various comments on its Academy competition in 1995 which was perhaps the steepest in recent times, comparisons to the book, (which I haven't read). I think though to truly reflect on it on its own merits. It is a simple tale of a simple man's journey through an amazing life. And although it requires a heavy suspension of disbelief, is that not the purpose of such pieces of entertainment? Are we not similarly uplifted when a Big Foot and two Abbot and Costello type robots help to save the galaxy? Or are we not transfixed with the characters of Jackson's LOTRs? The fact is that Forest is a lot less able than most of us yet he seems stumble into these wonderful adventures that through experience perhaps gives him a better level of understanding that we with our higher cranial capacity can't hope to emulate. Right to the last two scenes in which we see Forest having come to terms with the ambivalence losing the love that for so long eluded him, and yet getting to know the love of a son he never knew he had. In essence it's that old classic tale of the underdog. It is one of those old friendly cloaks that we can wrap around us for warmth on a cold night!If any the message perhaps that Bob Zemeckis is aiming for is that many of us go through life missing the good things along the way - the whole film being a metaphor for most people, no matter their place or station in the world, are given a number  of unappreciated blessings. Even that our own more complicated view of the world gives us a tarnished view of it. Where as Forest just does what he feels 'he' should or says exactly what he feels and is encumbered by the need to present himself in a light that requires the approval of his audience. Perhaps that is to philosophical a look at this film but then I am as I said more impressed with ability to entertain, after all is that not the first job of any films, if we were not able to be entertained through fiction perhaps we would sit at home watching CNN and The Discovery Channel. And as the man would say 'that's all I wan't to say about that right now!'As for the technical aspects of Forest Gump, well were do I start. The acting I thought throughout was excellent Hank's portrayal is more than just good, he sucks you in to the story and helps you form a bond with the main character early, and towards the end were most of the Dialog is by way of metronome precision narration (that keeps the timing of the film together) we see Forest running or on his mower or even just sitting around pondering what has gone before, Tom's facial interpretation of this is excellent. The direction is a major triumph for BZ and the supporting cast turn in stellar performances especially Gary Sinise who chemistry with Hanks has been called upon on two subsequent occasions. (Answers on a post card - EZ really!) All this under one of the best soundtracks ever and of course that wonderful Alan Silvestri score!Forest Rocks *****"
8 November 2014,Forrest Gump - A Heart Touching Movie!,,"I really love this movie! It got a lot of heart touching scenes.. I watched it many times. I also read the book. A very refreshing feel-good movie that is always entertaining and compelling, even if sometimes it is sentimental and seems a bit vague about its purpose. If you are able to overlook its flaws, you will find it a captivating story of innocence and optimism. You will love it as soon as you watch it.. It's really worth watching the movie. You should really check it out!It's perfect for watching with the whole family or just watching it alone. Have fun!"
19 March 2013,The Best in All of Us,,"A great comedy and a great and touching drama. I felt this movie achieved a perfect balance of comedy and drama and depth. A balance that pure drama and pure comedies often fail to achieve. To me, this film was more touching than movies that were intended to be mainly touching turned out to be. In that, Forrest Gump was a masterpiece.You see the small things he does and the greatness he inspires and causes in people all around him without having much intelligence. This helps remind us that no matter what kind of person we are, no matter what physical or mental capabilities we have, we still can cause so much greatness in people's lives both intentionally and in ways that we don't even know.The movie is also inspiration in that you see a picked on persevere and either not notice or completely ignore the ridicule and setbacks he faces. He takes it and he runs as hard as he can.His plain and complete niceness reminds us that it doesn't take much to be nice and cause positive change in other people's lives.Also, the bus scene setups were great, enabling the great flashback style and narration storytelling that made it great. It was finally great to see in the end someone who actually stayed to care and listen and skip their bus.Great movie. One of my favorite."
20 August 2002,Simply my favorite move.,,"I have said in other reviews here that other movies are my favorite, but only a select few all share my top number one spot. Forrest Gump is one of them. I felt I had to write something about it, after just seeing the end again on TV; I was just flipping and came across the ending of the most compelling movie ever.Need I say anyway of Tom Hanks' brilliance in this role, I just love the character of Forrest Gump. And the story-- oh, the story, it's so heartbreaking at times, it's so hysterical at times, it's so everything but bad at one point or another-- it's perfect. The story is told so well, the characters are so good, the lines are unforgettable. Needles to say the way they blended the amazing story in with real history is above brilliant... there isn't a thing wrong with this movie. It's my favorite of all time.Concluding, Forrest Gump is cinematic perfection, to all the highest degress. Everyone and thing in it is brillaint, ten out of ten, no, infinite stars is what this movie deserves. Forrest Gump is my favorite all time movie, and that's all I got to say about that."
3 March 2010,Hello Forrest =),,"He made a great step forward literally.. First he had his legs wrapped in iron and later he ran through the hole United States, just because he wanted to run, just carefree. This person has to be kind of naive or not? From the little kid that got mobbed to a national personality- that's the story of Forrest, Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump was actually the first movie that made me cry at the end. One now might think that it is a really sad story but there's also a lot of happiness in there. All that great things that naive Forrest experiences made me laugh.Although it is a quite long movie I could watch it again and again just because it's also very funny sometimes, it's the mix, I think between sadness and happiness that makes this movie one of the greatest ever."
29 September 2001,Touching,,"This is a story of an unremarkable man, the ordinary guy, the kid you always made fun of in high school for taking special ed... this is the story of that man finding happiness that many of us only seek. That someone can be satisfied from the purity and simplicity of his life is truly amazing and should be a lesson to us all.It's also a story of the differences between people, and how despite those differences we can still connect. He shares his life story with strangers while waiting for the bus, and he affects all of those characters in different ways, just like this movie affected different viewers in different ways. Some of them disregard him as just the dumb guy waiting for the bus, but some of them listen to him, most notably the older woman at the end who doesn't get on the bus because she truly wants to hear his story.There are many other ways to perceive this story. You can see it as the story of a man who loves a woman struggling between goodness and immorality, or as an essay on how people change over time, or even how ignorance can breed contentment.But no matter what you see in this movie, you find that it's a multi-faceted study on life, and you see glimpses of yourself in the characters. It reaches humans on every level - it makes us laugh, cry, contemplate... and our hearts soar whenever something good happens.Hopefully you too will watch this movie and get one step closer to figuring out exactly who you are."
4 October 1998,What's the fuss about?,,"This is another one of those ""I wish I had my money back"" movies.Against my better judgement, my wife talked me into this.  My first question at the theatre was, ""Who is Forrest Gump?"" And we found out.   He is/was an IQ'd challenged young man that fascinated people, mostly because of an implausible plot.{How about the hurricane sequence?} I also found out the movie's point of view is basically to insult American morals under it's thick veneer of 'art'. However, it is rather well made, with very nice production values, and some appropriate casting, namely Sally Field. Hanks, however, doesn't do the moron thing as well as say, Bill Murray might have done it. Oh, yes, the Viet Nam battle scene compares rather well with everything else similarly filmed on THAT subject. But once and for all folks, what's all the fuss about?"
24 December 2009,The Most Amazing Film!!!!,,This film is got everything!!! Its got the comedy of tom hanks and his part with him playing it brilliantly i don't think anyone could have played it better he bring out the seriousness of the situations hes in but still plays them like a child would.Then there's the story behind the comedy with it revolving around Forrest love interest in the film and him trying to win her back from the life's shes chosen..The direction in this film is truly amazing with the war scenes being intense and sad at the same time..A Classic!!!
29 March 2006,Perhaps a bit more complex than most would think...,,"Judging from the box office success, Forrest Gump is a film that has touched many millions of lives. It seems to work on many levels, some of which have been exhaustedly discussed in other opinions here. Shortly after seeing it at the cinema (a decade ago) it occurred to me that the character of Forrest Gump could be regarded as a metaphor for 20th century America. Starting from a difficult childhood, Forrest finds he has outgrown his disability, just as America's economic strength found its feet from 1900 to 1950. His pursuit of Jenny represents the American dream, lost to promiscuity and the moral blight of Vietnam. The death of Forrest's mother represents the passing of ""Norman Rockwell's America"" (for want of a better expression) and as we all know - a lot of sh** happened in the 70s. That Forrest finds wealth easily represents one of the great myths/truths about 20th century America - the land of opportunity. The parallels are numerous.It might seem a simple film about a simple man, but it's resonance is far from accidental. This film should be compulsory viewing for anyone seeking to understand the psyche of modern America."
19 October 2000,Not as good as book,,"FORREST GUMP is a perfect example of how books are much better than movies in some cases. The book was funny. This was not. The book was sardonic, satiric and ironic. This was not. And just because it won all those Oscars doesn't make it the movie of the year. Driving Miss Daisy, Dances With Wolves, Chariots of Fire and Titanic were all Best Picture winners, and if you ask me were all given too much credit. In the future, no one will remember FORREST GUMP. They'll just remember that somewhere along the way a movie fooled them into believing it was something more than what it really was: An overlong movie making fun of retarded people."
4 April 2001,(spoiler warning) Forrest and Forrest Jr. should get a blood test...,,"...because when you have unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman, and that woman has a child, you run a sort of, well, ""high risk"" of receiving HIV (especially Forrest Jr).  I guess ""Jennay"" forgot to tell that to Forrest before she died.  GET TESTED, FORREST, and RUN!I don't mean to be abrasive, but after a second viewing of ""Forrest Gump,"" I noticed this glaring omission.  Yes, it is the 1980s, so much less was known about the disease, but the filmmakers should have included something to let the audience know whether the Gump family would share the same fate as Jenny.  To me, this is a giant hole in the film, and one that needed to be addressed.And regarding the film itself...Personally, I'm in the middle; I don't love or hate ""Forrest Gump.""  The fact that it is overrated drove many to an extreme dislike for the film, yet some feel it is a masterwork.  To me, it is neither terrible or great.  It is a pretty good movie--enjoyable and humorous, but it is sometimes sappy, sentimental and contrived.  Some portions are great and some are poor.  In the end, the good outweighed the bad slightly, and I came away satisfied but not totally pleased.  Zemeckis has made better films (try ""Back to the Future,"" ""Contact,"" and even ""Cast Away""), and so has Hanks.I recommend ""Forrest Gump"" marginally because it has a good heart and a good, interesting story...but it also has its fair share of flaws.  ""Pulp Fiction"" and especially ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserved the Academy Awards, but oh well...don't complain over something so trivial...awards don't mean THAT much.""Forrest Gump"" can have a 7/10 from me."
1 April 2009,Retard Yourself With Retro-Culture!,,"If you're like me you hate to think; even worse is thinking about history- so much moral ambiguity, so much perspective and bothersome shades of grey... isn't there a movie out there that can assure me that everything that happened during the latter-half of the twentieth century was Just Fine- all while deafening me with jukebox favorites?Now you can! Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks proudly present ""Forrest Gump"" a left-wing work of right-wing propaganda that boldly proclaims the mentally retarded are not just AS GOOD as you and me, but better! And as a result, American Heroes!Forrest's IQ is charted at seventy, which means he will stay boyishly naive until the script calls for him to suddenly make a profound declaration for the Oscar clip: ""I'm not a smart man... but I know what love is."" Whatchyou talking' bout, Forrest?This is retro-active re-writing of pop-culture disguised as American history designed to make us all feel better about not understanding the exact details of the Watergate break-in or the black panther party. Forrest floats through life with the gravity- and substance- of a feather, tossing off sickeningly-pointless nothingisms: ""Life is like a box of chocolates..."" No, it isn't.It really, really isn't.His erstwhile girlfriend goes through every cliché of cultural extremism (flower child, disco burnout, AIDS corpse) to lecture the audience about the dangers of Actually Being Involved In Something! We'll be much better off if we listen to Mama like Forrest and dip our toes in the water only for the sake of a digitally-enhanced photo-opportunity. (Love the way you moved Lennon's lips to set up your clunker of a joke... that took a lot of class!) And finally the mystery of who taught Elvis to dance has been solved- it was a crippled simpleton, and not the butler as previously suspected.But the adventures don't end there: Zemeckis (Greek for arrogant-ignorant) wants us to believe that this Drooling Dandy was an integral part of EVERY significant historical event: Gump meets JFK, carves Mount Rushmore, builds the sun, performs open-heart surgery! Forrest saves a fellow soldier during The War (good) who happens to be black (better) and inherits a shrimping boat (obviously)... we meet Gary Sinise's Lieutenant Dan who has the gall to question Gump's ability; for this his legs are blown off and he's doomed to an entire life of pain and suffering. Don't fear the retard...All of Forrest's toothless adventures are washed down with some of the most over-played soundtrack songs of the era, until the Dumb One takes to the road for a series of painful gags, increasing exponentially in stupidity until finally he's left with the motherless son he never wanted nor could possibly raise. (It's the next best thing to Immaculate Conception.) Are we vomiting yet?Ultimately, Forrest Gump proves that Tom Hanks was so good in ""Philadelphia"" that we weren't finished giving him Oscars, and the movie's other trophies only go to prove that we're the very lemmings They think we are, preferring glossy bile over thought-provoking quality.This is ""Pop-Culture for Dummies"" masquerading as American History and quality film. Will rot your brain like crack-cocaine.GRADE: F"
9 April 2003,The Clean Livin' Republican's Handbook,,"A slyly reactionary movie - kinda the republican's handbook for good,clean livin'. 'Gump' would like to perpetuate the myth that the best wayto get ahead in today's America is to be asexual, stupid and do asyou're told...Heaven forbid you should be a peace-loving, free thinkingliberal - for your troubles you should expect a childhood filled withabuse, followed by drug-addled suicidal tendencies, an unhappy love-lifeand, ultimately, death by a coyly unspecified disease.In short, 'Forrest Gump' is about as politically progressive as 'ReeferMadness', and the movie's technical proficiency just makes it's messageall the more unpalatable..............3/10........"
25 June 2000,Tom Hanks and Amazing Special Effects,,"""Forrest Gump"" dominated 1994.  The film was a box office smash and won six Academy Awards.  Tom Hanks (in his second Oscar winning performance consecutively) plays a simple man with an IQ of 75 who is somehow involved with every major American event from the mid-1950s to the early-1980s. Through his journey we meet his mother (Sally Field), his one true love Jenny (Robin Wright), his friend from the army Bubba (Mykelti Williamson), and his commanding officer Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise in an Oscar-nominated performance).  Gump is thrown into every significant event through amazing visual effects and editing techniques.  ""Forrest Gump"" is an outstanding achievement in the cinema from every point imaginable.  The cast is great and so are the mind-blowing visual effects which are still unbelievable six years later.  Robert Zemeckis, a Steven Spielberg disciple, became a household name with this film.  The screenplay is based on a book that was hardly read by anyone before this film came out in 1994.  It was the best film of 1994 and, with the exception of ""Schindler's List"", may be the best and most important film of the 1990s.  The fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar over ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" just adds to the greatness of this outstanding motion picture.  5 stars out of 5."
25 May 1999,It was okay,,"A movie where I can see why people liked it, but I simply wasn't one of them.  First of all, Tom Hanks performance deserves praise.  His performance was dead on and wonderful.  The supporting actors deserve praise as well ( especially Gary Sinise).  The film editing was great as well.The movie itself did not move me like the Shawshank Redemption did ( both released in 1994).  The writing in Shawshank was much better ( one award of the six Gump won).The story of a simpleton floating through life doesn't appeal to me. There seemed to be no forward drive, and Robert Zemeckis seemed to want to create a surreal world ( where people are hurt, but not too badly) and ground it solidly in realism, which just doesn't work.I thought it deserved Best Actor, Supporting Actor, and Film Editing. The other three should have gone to other films"
1 November 1998,One of a kind.,,"I usually judge a movie by the effect it has on me and how I generally feel after watching it. To me, Forrest Gump ranks up there with Schindler's List. There were a lot of memorable scenes in the film but the part I liked the most is the part when Jenny is about to die and Forrest tells her of all the things he experienced in Vietnam and his cross-country hike. Jenny tells him that it would have been nice to be with him during those times. Forrest tells her, ""But you were, Jenny."" Corny? Maybe. But then again, not too many films can bring out human emotions this film does."
19 June 2004,in my eyes its disgraceful to insult this movie,,"After reading some of the disgusting reviews of this film, i feel that to insult such a brilliant masterpiece is disgraceful. this movie has touched me in a way that no other movie has. it 110% completely deserves the awards it received. tom hanks gives one of his greatest performances in this film, and the way the story is brought together is absolutely brilliant. anyone who says this movie is bad, has probably been watching the wrong film!in all i feel this movie is truly among the greats of our time. the simplicity of this movie makes it truly remarkable. if you have not seen it yet then get of your seat and run down the DVD shop and buy! you will not regret it."
13 December 1998,"Stupid is as stupid does, and ""Forrest Gump"" proves it",,"I was surprised to find so many others who held the same opinion as I about the movie ""Forrest Gump"".  The nation laughed and cried along with Forrest throughout the course of the movie and through pure visceral emotion, resulted in Academy Awards out the wazoo.  If this movie evoked any kind of response out of me, I might say it made me cry... out of pure boredom.  I was disappointed in the ridiculousness of ""Forrest Gump"", a lot of the reason being because I hold Tom Hanks in such high regard and never once thought that he would be one to promote the patronizing American Dream theory.  It completely blows my mind that this movie received so many awards and so much hype when it is utterly unbelievable and absolutely unrealistic. The braces bursting from Forrest's legs, his unintentional football scholarship to college, his meeting the president (and might I add his only words to Mr. Kennedy were ""I have to go pee""), his millions earned through ping-pong, his (how pathetic) running across America four times for ""no reason at all"", his ""inventing"" the happy face symbol by wiping his face on a towel... all this is just incredibly... stupid, if I may be so blunt.  The movie attempts to show that to succeed in life, one does not need to be overly intelligent, all one needs is a lot of heart.  Very touching, but dense all the same and the movie is so far out that viewers only see it as entertainment and will not derive motivation to make something of themselves.  Tom Hanks does a wonderful job and is convincing as a mentally-challenged man, but the movie as a whole, the supposed ""story-line"" and non-existent plot are pathetic and hold no ground.  ""Forrest Gump"" deserved no awards in my opinion."
16 October 1999,Too long,,"This wasn't anything special, if you want to know my thinking-I really thought they went over board in their putting Forrest the Dummox here into Every significant historical event since '55,. So he saw Elvis, JFK, did Vietnam, Watergate, started the jogging craze, had his slutty gal die of Aids, etc. So what? The film shoulda ended before they started the whole Forrest Running across the USA  bit; instead it got milked and milked even farther than before.Gimme a break.I liked Hanks' work here, and some of the direction, but the whole film struck me as being an overlong episode of either the Twilight Zone or Quantam Leap. So Forrest was there for everything important in Western Culture since Ike-so what??? Yawn.**1/2 outta ****, gimme Back to the Future or American Graffiti anytime over this."
24 March 2002,only mildly entertaining...,,"This movie was indeed like a box of chocolates. The problem is, I don't like chocolate. I think I had more laughs reading the comments about this movie [""greatest movie ever!!!...Tom Hanks best acting job!!!"" etc.] than I did watching the movie itself. I guess it was a great movie if all you are used to are Adam Sandler movies...Of course, I don't think it's the total piece of garbage that some reviewers called it, either. But I certainly don't understand the accolades this mediocre comedy/melodrama inspires. Now, what is funny are the people who thought Tom Hanks's hokey and uneven portrayal of Gump was ""brilliant!!!, fantastic!!!"" etc. If you want to see someone do some REAL acting, go watch Peter Sellers in the 1979 classic ""Being There""...a movie with intelligence."
12 November 2002,"Again,what's the point?",,"I've seen this movie at least 4 or 5 times. I see at least once a year and try to figure out what's missing. The answer is always: nothing. And everything. This movie is over hyped, overproduced, and overacted. My friends who liked the movie say I missed the entire point. I don't think so. It starts with some shocking vulgar scenes of Forrest's youth such as his mother sleeping with the school's principal in order for her son to be accepted at a `normal school' and other kids bullying him around because he can't walk -or act- normally. Throughout the movie we see Forrest succeeding at everything he tries, not because he really tries, but because things seem to fall from the sky right in his hands. Example: he becomes wealthy after investing in an `apple company' which was in fact Apple computers. Oh, oh the irony. Plus to most viewers annoyance (yes even the ones who think the movie is a classic) he keeps faithful to his girlfriend Jenny, a personification of the decadence of 60's America, even after she dumps him badly a couple of times.He have taught Elvis to dance, he was a hero in Nam, he met President Kennedy, John Lennon, he unveiled the Watergate Scandal, he played ping-pong in communist China.question is.what didn't he do? The message seems to be: ""No matter how hard you try, there'll be some idiot better than you at everything"". Topped with some cheap tavern philosophy (life is like a box of chocolates) this movie is a butt aching doodle. Avoid it at all cost."
26 September 2002,"Ma nime's Forse, Forse Guh-uhmp...",,"FORREST GUMP was a much more enjoyable experience for me when I was a boy. I thought it was a wonderful, magical tale about taking life slow and easy. But now I am older, and I see it as little more than an overlong showcase of clichés in which Tom Hanks talks in an embarrassing Southern drawl and plays a cardboard caricature.I admire Forrest for the good old boy that he is; unfortunately, that's ALL he is. If you will pardon the hyperbole, our mentally retarded hero is so pure and innocent and decent and good-hearted that he makes Jimmy Stewart's character in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE look like a child pornographer. Whether he's the knight in shining armor protecting girlfriend Jenny from any menace; the selfless warrior rescuing all his comrades in the heat of battle; or the pious Christian whose faith remains fervent even as Lieutenant Dan Taylor curses God, Forrest Gump never does anything morally questionable.In addition, throughout the film Gump displays an ""idiot savant"" personality type that really gets on my nerves. Now I know that some autistic people are blessed with highly unusual skills, but it is simply not feasible that Forrest is perfect at everything he does. He runs faster, plays better ping-pong, assembles a rifle quicker, is more successful in the business world, and in general proves to be a whiz at almost everything through a combination of freakish talent and dumb luck.Not to be insensitive, but I think Gump had it pretty swell. After miraculously overcoming a childhood infirmity (really!) by busting the braces on his legs through sheer willpower, Forrest has an infinite string of good luck while all of his friends and loved ones either die painful deaths, surrender to their personal demons, or become human vegetables. These are the characters we should feel sorry for, and not Forrest Gump.If Gump had been plagued with at least ONE character flaw - alcoholism, for instance, or some kind of sexual disorder - then maybe I would find it easier to sympathize with him and rejoice in his many accomplishments. As it is, however, Hanks's character is hopelessly squeaky-clean.Which is not to say that FORREST GUMP is an inherently bad movie. It's fine, I suppose, if you like simpleminded morality plays. For the more cynical among us, however, GUMP is just too gummy."
29 March 2001,how in the world did this film win an Oscar?,,"This wasn't a bad movie...it is an OK movie..but an OSCAR award winning movie?? I agree with other posters that Shawshank Redemption and Morgan Freeman should've received the Oscars in 95. I got nothing out of Gump, in fact, I don't even remember what the movie is about except that Hanks undeservingly won an award for his portrayal of a villiage idiot. Meanwhile, I own a copy of shawshank and I can always watch it when the time is right. Shawshank is a great movie to watch. It is no surprise today that Gump is ranked in the bottom of IMDB top list at #172 while Redemption is #2...what a travesty of justice bought on by the Academy that a movie like Gump wins an oscar over Shawshank."
11 December 2005,forrest gump-truly meaningful,,"although many people thought that forrest gump was boring and were frustrated by forrest's simpleness, this movie is actually a great source of symbolism of how simpleness can lead to happiness. As viewed in certain religions, such as daoism, simpleness is the way to truth and understanding of how the world works.Forrest gump never tried to change things, and never had egotistic and meddlesome efforts to turn something into something else. This made his live simple and care-free, and ideal life style. Whenever he gained something, he did not take advantage of it or try to manipulate its powers. Instead, he accepted it, and if it happened to leave his hands, did not ponder over its departure. this attitude of life led him to be truly happy, something that is hard to do, even though it may not seem so. he never stopped loving, even though his friend from childhood took twists and turns and they grew their separate ways. It was a very touching movie. he took things as they came, never stopped loving,was truly happy, and that,therefore makes him one of the wisest human beings."
6 July 2005,Forrest Gump is a metaphor of the 60s,,"This movie is simply a metaphor of the 60s. Forrest, the simpleton, is representative of the simple man; everyman, and Jenny is a '60s seeker'. Forrest goes through life as most of us do: living, loving, meeting his obligations, whereas, Jenny, is constantly seeking, and finally finds that what is meaningful has always been within her reach.Winston Groom wrote the acclaimed Vietnam War novel Better Times Than These, the prize-winning As Summers Die, and co-authored Conversations with the Enemy, which was nominated for a 1984 Pulitzer Prize. He is also the author of the No.1 New York Times bestsellers Forrest Gump and Gumpisms: The Wit and Wisdom of Forrest Gump. Mr Groom's Shrouds of Glory, an account of Confederate General John Bell Hood's decisive actions in the last great campaign of the US Civil War, was published in April, 1995. He lives in New York City and Point Clear, Alabama.I find it terrific that this 'best political' movie escaped, Hollywood unnoticed."
2 September 2005,The best movie,,"Forrest Gump is the most pretty and emotional movie I've ever seen. There are many scenes with an intensity witch you car rarely watch in the universe of the movies. The way Tom Hanks conduce Forrest make us believe in a kind of behavior witch is very uncommon, but possible in a human being. Besides, there are many beautiful scenes that make any sensitive person in tears.Forrest Gump loves Jenny Curran since they were children, and she takes years to understand it and even feel the same, but after she dies, one day he goes to her splutter, and there is wrote ""Jenny Gump"". The poetry in this final scene is something that no other love story may have. About the relationship between Forrest and his mother, the movie shows the true perfection in every mother's love in the world."
15 January 2003,"""Why don't you love me, Jenny?""",,"What will make this film endure is its apolitical skew when commenting on major political events. Everyone is parodied, everyone's hypocrisy revealed through Forest's simplicity, including the peaceniks - which is a welcome change to say the least. I truly believe this is one of the better films of the last quarter century. The reliance on special effects unfortunately will weaken this film over time, that's just inevitable. When you watch it now, the insertion of Forest into a number of historical events, which is a huge part of the film, already show an antiquated technology. While this was a new thing and sold the movie when it was released, it's more of a distraction now. There are roughly ten major scenarios or chapters in Forest's life that the film chronicles. Each completely as unrelated as can be imagined, but they are all done so well and woven together so finely, that never once is continuity threatened. The fifteen minutes or so of Viet Nam is as good as that gets. The photography goes heavy on the earth's natural beauty, and seeks to subliminally remind us how meaningless are all of the seemingly crucial events that pop off while we live our lives. Forest's inferior intellect allows him, although sadly unrealistically, to seek and win simple love, gain serendipitous fame and fortune, and ultimately attain nirvana because he is not burdened by intellectual fear or cerebral reasoning. Really makes you stop and think about what is important in this life we are blessed with."
8 February 2003,GREAT STUFF,,This film is brilliant maybe i like this because it goes through his life which i always love or maybe it is the great acting by tom hanks as usual.The film ended up winning the best picture at the 1994 oscars in a year full of great but some times wierd films like 'pulp fiction' and the slow 'shawshank redemption'. Anyway the film was well acted and very interesting.
24 September 2009,My opinion of the movie,,I thought that Forrest Gump was a great overall movie. It was a comedy but also could make you sad. With all that it also did a lot of good history background. I also think that Forrest Gump is a very inspirational movie for anyone. It showed that someone like Forrest Gump can show others what life is all about and also what is important in life. They mention and show many different historical events. One example is the Vietnam War and what things were like there. I think the thing I liked the most is how they made Forrest Gump the character show people that the little things in life are more important. Such examples are being a love and caring person towards your family and friends. I also think a message of keeping promises to the most important people in your life is showed through this morning. That is a very important message.
3 June 2000,It did deserve the oscar,,"A lot of people put Forrest Gump down saying among other things, that it is mediocre, didn't deserve the oscars, and is totally overrated. Well well well, I thinks these people are just jealous that such a nice-natured, clean and harmless movie won over Pulp Fiction, the epitomy of a cool film wanna-be.Overrated? C'mon it got much less hype than almost every movie released these days. At least Forrest Gump had content and depth as opposed to Pulp Fiction which didn't even have a point.Forrest Gump is an excellent movie. You can tell that a lot of work has gone into it, and everything about it is great, the acting, the script, the directing and cinematography, it's all excellent and above all, it's a great story!Rent/buy this video if you want to see a proper movie, instead of such B-grade tripe as Pulp Fiction."
29 July 2004,Commerating the 10th Anniversary of an American classic,,"Wow,it has been ten years ago........By the time ""Forrest Gump"" swept most of the major 1994 Academy Awards,it had already become the third-highest grossing film of all time,as well as a genuine pop phenomenon embracing best selling books,gnomic catch phrases,and reams of commentary on the editorial pages of magazines and newspapers throughout the world. It has already broken box office records worldwide and stands behind great cinema classics like ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"",""E.T."",""Titanic"",""The Lion King"",and so many more. Even through its distribution of its market through DVD and video,it has grossed even more domestic wealth and still holds that mark as of today,even after its release more than ten years ago. Clearly,a great event,FORREST GUMP,is a great film and a great piece of cinematic magic within itself. It has the form of an epic that goes within the boundaries of depth and resonance;the trappings of satire without a coherent attitude,and the semblance of historical revisionism without a critical sensibility. To paraphrase the screenplay,FORREST GUMP,may not be a smart film,but it knows what love is-its dim-witted protagonist,as expertly portrayed by Tom Hanks,has captured the love of millions,which by the way made Tom Hanks,the Jimmy Stewart of our generation.Despite its limitations,FORREST GUMP has charm to spare,thanks to an enduring central performance by Tom Hanks,as well as a series of irresistibly playful historical tableau's achieved with unprecedented verisimilitude by the computer-savvy artists at George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. Although fictional protagonists have been made to interact with historical figures in CITIZEN KANE and ZELIG,FORREST GUMP represents a technological breakthrough. Unfortunably it is also far less thoughtful than these illustrious processors,and at times seems nearly as simple minded as its protagonist. While FORREST GUMP stands out as a break taking cinematic masterpiece,it is a remarkably brilliant one through various scenes as it follows the character through three decades of turmoil which begins with his upbringing in rural Greenbow,Alabama through various events that featuring computerized images of Governor George Wallace,President Kennedy at the White House,and his meeting with President Johnson as Forrest receives the Medal Of Honor for bravery during his turmoil in Vietnam and that continues throughout as he joins a ping-pong team that takes a tour of China and his meeting with President Nixon,and accidentally uncovers the Watergate break-in of the 1970's. However,its vision of the Vietnam War,for example,is constructed not from historical memory,but by means of a deft deployment of clichés drawn from the most prominent movies that display the Vietnam War in general(examples from such films as Apocalypse Now,The Deer Hunter,Coming Home,Platoon,and Born On The Fourth Of July).Indeed,director Robert Zemeckis's period recreations depend more on the music of that period than any other visual sense of time and place:once the wall to wall soundtrack of the period kicks in which contains hits from various groups from the 1960's and early 1970's. The characters here are very well supportive with outstanding performances from actresses Sally Field,and Robin Wright-Penn to actor Gary Sinise's portrayal of Lt. Dan,who does a fair impression of Willem Dafoe from two Oliver Stone films;PLATOON(with legs)and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (without as a paraplegic)to a supportive acting from Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend Bubba. Although Winston Groom's original novel contains some astringent satire,the film's version settles for gentle jabs at racism and the military. Unusually vague it is attitude towards the events and its depicts,FORREST GUMP went on the sweep the Oscars for Best Picture,Best Director(Robert Zemeckis),Best Actor(Tom Hanks), Best Adapted Screenplay(Eric Roth),and Best Supportive Actor(Gary Sinise),and still went on the become one of the biggest moneymaking films of 1994.Even after ten years,it is still embraced by several national figures as a celebration of traditional values and a condemnation of the 1960's counterculture. In many ways,the film still represents old-fashioned Hollywood liberalism where racists are wrong,war is hell,assassinations are bad,and it's good to be nice--even if the world is different from various places. Still,the films a lot of heart and a lot of guts and brains to make it possible. Congradulations on your 10th Anniversary-- FORREST GUMP."
13 March 1999,One of 1994's best,,"I've seen a great many movies, but when I saw ""Forrest Gump"", I was delighted.  I don't own it--I don't want to see it more than the two times I've seen it already, but this film was a valuable experience for me.It wasn't the best film of 1994 (that would be ""Pulp Fiction""), the best directed (""Natural Born Killers""), or even the best written (""Pulp..."", ""Clerks"", ""The Last Seduction""), but there hasn't been a whole lot of movies that have been as emotionally rich or powerful as this one.  Robert Zemeckis has the power to exhaust me, whether it's my emotions (""Contact"", this film), my visual cortex (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Contact""), or my funny bone (""Used Cars"").  His screenplay is responsible for anything positive that came out of Steven Spielberg's 1979 flop ""1941"", (except for that astonishing dance sequence).  Here he tops his past films and screenplays and has not done quite as good since then.I'll be honest:  sentimentality has its proper place and time, and must be done right.  This film has it.  I laughed and cried, and was struck dumb with awe.Its six Oscars meant that a few better films, performers, and technicians were robbed blind, but let's be real, folks:  they're Academy Awards.  It's a popularity contest, and as long as we see it for what it is, we can just sit back and enjoy them.  ""Forrest Gump"" wouldn't get any prizes from me, for the simple reason that any category would be won by another film.  But an Oscar?  Sure, what the heck."
10 April 2000,"A fairy tale, but then much more.",,"This movie is a fairy tale, and its review of US history is oversimplified at best. But because the movie does not claim realism, these things don't bother me the way they normally do. The movie is light and mostly funny while you watch it, but what sticks is much deeper. It is a modern version of a classic literary theme: the idiot who is thereby wiser than the rest of us.  Forrest is too dumb to hate blacks.  He is too dumb not to keep his promises and give away his money. He is too dumb not to save Lt. Dan, twice, once in battle and later, through continued good will and positive attitude, from himself.  He is too dumb to give up on his hopeless love. One is left inspired by this modern morality play, inspired to try to be a little better person, in hopes that in real life goodness might have just a bit of the effects it has in this movie.I watched this movie with my kids, ages 10 and 13. It was more explicit than I expected for a PG-13, and halfway through I wondered if I had made a mistake showing it to them. But no, it was a very good movie for them, for the reasons discussed above.  Also for another reason: their knowledge of the times of the movie was limited, and their questions from the movie led to several good discussions."
3 June 2000,One of the best,,"Forrest Gump is the best movie of 1994. The only other movie that comes close is Ed Wood. What makes this movie so great and enjoyable is that everything is so interesting. I've seen this movie a hundred times, and I never lose interest. The performances are so great. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his great career. He makes you think even when he just sits there and stares. Like when he is just sitting there on the porch thinking. Also Gary Sinise is superb as Dan Taylor. Mykelti Williamson is memerable as Gumps kind of lugish friend Bubba. And Sally Field is great like always.Although this film is through the eyes of a very simple man, it is about a big question. Do we all have a destiny in life or are we all just floating like a feather on a breeze? Gump tries to find this out but all he finds out the only things important in life is the love of true friends, and family. Nothing else matters. Not awards from presidents, being a football star, or being a shrimping tycoon. Only being in the arms of your true love.This movie is superb in every way. Every one in America should see this film."
24 September 2002,Beautifully imperfect commentary on America,,"Hailed as a classic when it first came out, ""Forrest Gump"" now appears to be looked upon as a travesty, a shallow celebration of America's innocence. Yet this retrospective view is somewhat missing the point.  For while the character of Forrest Gump is portrayed as being genuinely innocent, the American ""innocence"" he represents is not, nor is it ever intended to be.In this, the film works well both as life story and as unique commentary on the last 30 years of American history.  As played by Micheal Connor Humphreys and then Tom Hanks, Forrest Gump is a slow-witted but good hearted young man raised in Greenbow, Alabama by his feisty housekeeping mother(Sally Field).  Forrest's good intentions, his ability to run at great speeds, as well as his love for his abused and misguided best friend Jenny (who grows up to be Robin Wright) drive and define his life.  Forrest goes to college, enlists for the US Army and survives a posting to Vietnam and his various encounters with prominent historical figures, including JFK. Forrest recounts all of this to others whilst sitting on park bench awaiting a bus.This is far from a perfect film.  The many numerous spottable gaffes and mistakes put the Academy to shame for naming it Best Film of 1994.  The digital effects have dated, as has the tinkering of the various real video footage.  Yet this is largely superficial when considering the film's graces.The film's direction and use of music for scenes are very good in places, particularly for the scenes in Washington D.C with Forrest's triumphant reunion with Jenny after returning from Vietnam.Yet the film's defining point has to be it's acting.  Sally Field and Robin Wright give solid support; Field always the supportive and caring mother (who isn't above boffing the headmaster to get Forrest entry into a 'normal' school) and Wright as his loving, but self-destructive soulmate.  Gary Sinise also turns in a fine performance as Leiutenant Dan, who is crippled in Vietnam but whom, with Forrest's help, finds redemption and regains a sense of self.But this is Tom Hank's film.  However gushed his Oscar acceptance may have been, he did deserve the award for a performance that is alot more complex than first appears.  On the surface and to the core, Forrest is naive but essentially good individual.  Yet his park bench recollections continually undermine the idea of American innocence, rather than celebrating it.Forrest wistfully recalls his absent father being a member of the Klu Klux Clan.  Anyone with even a smattering of knowledge of American history will know the Clan were a gang of vicious white supremacists, rather than ""people who dressed up ghosts, or spooks or something"".  Forrest continually comments on the history he encounters in a very simplistic way that invites to both laugh at Forrest, as well as with him.This irony is repeated throughout the movie, even in throwaway moments. One such moment is Forrest and Leiutenant Dan's encounter with two whores in a bar just as New Year dawns on 1972.  One of the whores says with sadness in her voice ""Don't you just love New Years?  You can start all over. Everybody gets a second chance...........""Hank's triumph is to combine the ironic aspects of Forrest Gump with the genuine warmth and sentimentality that is a part of the character.  With his much-quoted lines and awkward body language, he evokes sympathy from the audience.  His best moments in this come when he tells Jenny ""I'm not a smart man.  But I know what love is"", meeting his five year old son for the first time, and his final graveside speech to Jenny.Whilst ""Pulp Fiction"", released at the same time and contrasted with this film, may be a witty and irreverent take on the grimy realities of American life, it cannot compare with the grand combination of irony and warm sentiment in ""Forrest Gump""."
20 October 2000,A truly magical film,,"I liked this one. A mentally challenged man meets presidents Kennedy and Nixon, serves in Vietnam, becomes a shrimp guru, discovers the truth about Watergate...all the while he never loses sight or stops looking for the one thing that is most important to him, the love of his girl Jenny. It might have its flaws, but what film doesn't? The cast is first-rate, and Mr. Hanks gives a great performance worthy of the Oscar he received. *** out of ****"
26 November 2000,"See it, even if it's just to make you feel smart",,"I rather liked it.  It was touching, often very funny, but somehow, Forrest went from the ""loveable idiot"" of Winston Groom's novel to a ""leftover innocent"" who goes with the flow.  Still, I think Tom Hanks did a good job as Forrest, as did the rest of the cast.What I really liked, I think, were the references to the ""greats"" of the day like Elvis, JFK and such, but they don't really SAY who they are.And then there's everyone going around in a hurry as America goes from the idyllic pastel days of the fifties and into the disillusioned, paisley world of the sixties.  But through it all, Forrest has no idea what's going on.He does everything well, I think, like his drills (G*****n genius with an outstanding IQ) or a shrimp captain (pure luck + prayer), and father (don't know how he did that).  And mostly, he goes with his heart wherever his brain cannot (which is QUITE frequently).And that, I think, was what the movie was trying to say."
5 January 1999,A real weepie,,"I must admit I came close to tears while watching 'Forrest Gump'.  I nearly cried when I realised I'd invested AUD$11 and a couple of hours of my life on such an exceptionally worthless film.To pick up the thread from another viewer, this film dishes out a puritanical (read: American) fable whose message is: if you're conservative, straight and don't rock the boat, all will be well; but be outrageous, rebellious and buck the system, you get AIDS and die.Very over-rated piece of hyped up shlock."
24 April 2001,"spectacular,interesting and at no point boring",,"This film is well present and Tom Hanks brings 'Forest' to life.He brings the sensitivity,courage and bravery out in his character.I love this film and know it almost word for word i can't seem to get enough of it.My favourit part would be when he finally gets married to jenny, although i was upset when she died from the cancer, in many respects i can relate to this film alot and that's probably why i love it so much"
7 June 2002,sssss,,"Forrest Gums is a charming film that captivates audiences and wraps you up in a beautiful story about life and the american dream. This movie is the stuff that dreams are made of and the characters easily warm your heart. I would say that this film is certainly an epic and I've always felt it was an emotional rollercoaster. This film is not easily forgotten and has that magic that only so many films have. Tom Hanks gives one of the best performances ever in film history. Great special effects, and an incredible soundtrack work together to create the classic that is Forrest Gump."
28 July 1999,Good film...not great...,,"This is a very good film, but not great.  I think that after seeing it over and over again it isn't all it's cracked-up to be.  Tom Hanks is a good actor, but why did he win the Oscar?  I think the Academy just wanted to make history with a consecutive Oscar win again.  He did deserve the Oscar for ""Philadelphia"" though.  The basic facts are if you like Hanks watch ""Philadelphia"" or ""Big"".  If you like Sally Field watch ""Norma Rae"".  If you like Sinese and Wright though watch this one."
8 December 2016,One of my Favourite films,,One of my Favourite film's of all time. Tom Hanks wonderful actor and still is! There are a lot of real life learning lessons in this film not to mention Emotional and very emotional scenes that have followed me through my life. Also the fact that i watches this film in my teens and i am now in my 40's and i still feel like it's the first time i have watched it how funny is that. You know While I am writing this review I think I will actually watch it again now. 18th time of watching this film can't get enough of it. Classic film classic I say it again.

7 July 1999,If you liked this...,,"If you liked ""Forrest Gump,"" PLEASE see two films with similar themes but which are far more profound:""Dersu Uzala"" by Akira Kurosawa.  It's the only Kurosawa film on the Vatican Top 45 film list; it won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film in 1976; the main character is purportedly the basis for Yoda in the ""Star Wars"" saga.""Being There"" with Peter Sellers.  As funny as it is touching.If you see these films, you'll be a better person for it."
10 January 2023,Tom hank's bet performance,,"Forrest gump is a interesting film the plot well constructed and the direction intructive.It's about an innocent man how the world should be: he's honest and loyal. He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart.Spoiler: when Forrest gump save hi friend it's reall an emovant moment cult, captivating, innoation, funny moving magical.Tom hanks is a good actor and Robert Zemenski did a excellent job directing this film and the role of it's main charater.It is Witout a doubt on of the best Zemenki's fim after back to the future. I saw this film when a was 7 and also today is the best film I saw. ""run Forret Run"" is stay in all of head. And me two when i'm run I thik at this sentence go in my head !Really good Film, I reommende It !"
27 August 2001,Tear jerker,,"This is an old fashioned tear jerker that might not appeal to everyone. But its heart is in the right place.  I enjoyed it when I first saw it in the cinema and I look forward to watching it again, although I can imagine it might not date very well, especially viewed alongside the high tension, high effects and sensationalised movies of today."
7 January 2011,Forrest Gump,,"Forrest GumpForrest: My momma always said,""life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""It is a 1994 American comedy-drama film based on a novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, staring Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Gary Sinise. The story is of the Forrest Gump, a man from Alabama, his travels all over the world and the experiences he has had in his life. The film was first released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and was well received by critics. It earned over $677 million worldwide. The film garnered multiple awards and nominations, including Academy Awards, Golden Globe Awards, People's Choice Awards, and Young Artist Awards. The film starts by showing a feather floating in the sky and coming to Forrest's shoes. Then we see Forrest, sitting at a bus stop, taking the feather and telling his life story to the woman sitting next to him. As he tells his story, the listeners at bus stop change. Some of them are indifferent; some do not believe him while some others are interested and even fascinated. He was born with strong legs as we see later but with a crooked spine. The first day of school he met Jenny, the girl who changed his life. Once while they were walking among the trees, some boys tried to bully him. Jenny shouted"" run Forrest, run"" he started running and tore the strings which tied his special shoes. From that time on we see that his special ability and talent is running. While in college, again he was bullied by some boys, and this time ran through football field where he was recognized by the coach and invited to the team. After that he was taken to arm where he met his best friend Bouba who died later on in Vietnam. He saved some lives and also got wounded during the war and when he came back he received a Medal of Honor. While in hospital, his hobby was playing ping pong. He became a member of Army's team and went to China and won the competition with the Chinese and became a national hero. During his life he met different presidents and other famous people like John Lennon. All his life he was in love with Jenny and finally he married she and they had a son whom she had called Forrest. He started his shrimp business and became successful in it. Then through Lit. Dan, who he had met during war, invested some money in other businesses but went back to his hometown and lived with his momma till she died. For some years he was running without any reason. After Jenny's death he continued his life bringing up his son. It seems as if the feather which is carried by the breeze and is left in its hands and goes wherever is taken, is Forrest himself who is moved all his life by others. In the film in a scene when he was talking to Jenny's grave he was wondering ""if we are all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze"". The first days of his life it was his mother who told him what to do or not to do. Later it was Jenny who took up the role and it was by her demand that he even overcame his physical problem. This shows itself so vividly in Forrest's first encounter with Drill Sergeant when he answers the Sergeant that he was there"" to do whatever you tell me, Drill Sergeant!"". Even his success in ping pong was due to the fact that the first day he was told not to take his eyes off the ball.The times he starts doing something without others ordering him, the action is misled by others. It can be shown best in his period of life when he started running. At first nobody paid attention to him but after a while he was surrounded by lots of reporters who tried to label him by some movement. Although he was completely ignorant, the answers he gave to those questions inspired some people. In the process, he forms the iconic""simply face"" logo and tells the man to ""Have a nice day"". This way others try to control his actions.Although he had no plan, by his actions, which sometimes even seemed stupid, he changed the way of American history. While staying with President Nixon in Watergate hotel, it was by his phone call that the security office was informed of what was going on there and it initiated the Watergate scandal. In his interview with Dick Cavett, where John Lennon was a guest too, his answers inspired Lennon to write his famous song ""imagine"". Finally we can say he was an individual who had no will. When he was in love, he was treated in a way he even did not know his feeling and later on when he was told the child was his, he accepted it without hesitation. He was an individual who was affected by collective will. Whenever they wanted they sent him to war and when they were tired of war they took him to anti-war meeting to talk against war. During Cold War he was sent to China to beat the enemy in sport field. He is the individual human being without any will who is taken wherever he is destined to."
8 August 1998,Highly overrated movie about a geeky american hero,,"Whilst this movie tries to be a serious piece of ""art"", all it ever achieves is an incredible ""we-love-America-cause-everyone-can-be-someone-here""Tom Hanks gained lot of credit for playing Forrest Gump so brilliantly, but I can't really say I was impressed. All he did was behave more stupid than usually. Anyone could do that, as far as I'm concerned. But I have to give it some credit for all the good ""Gump-liners"" like ""stupid is as stupid does"". Want to see a good American movie? Watch ID4 or As good as it gets. Don't watch this one."
19 January 2000,Watched it so much it became boring.,,"I loved this movie and I've watched it 26 times! I watched it one night with my mum and dad when I was eight years old and I enjoyed it. I'm almost 13 now. Anyway, I watched it again and then when I got a good report card I was allowed a video and I immediately chose this one. Since then I've watched it 24 times and 2 before that. I've never watched anything else as much as this one."
12 February 2011,"The ""Gone With the Wind"" of the Baby-Boomer Generation",,"This movie has been on TV a lot lately, and just last night the excellent TCM channel showed it---I'm not sure if it was edited, because it was so engrossing and moving I would not have noticed an F-word or any other classless anomaly that sprung from the baby-boomer generation. ""Forrest Gump"" is a masterpiece, placing Robert Zemekis on the same deserved pedestal as Spielberg, Ford, Fleming or Minnelli.The emotional similarity between ""Gump"" and ""GWTW"" is evident by the end of the movie. In GWTW we watched as the Old South died and passed into legend....in Gump, we watch the beginning of the death of our entire nation as drug-addled baby-boomers and minorities who never knew a day of slavery in their lives began the slow destruction one of the truly greatest nations in the history of the planet. At the end of Gump, the America that some of its citizens today still insist exists, is actually dead...it's long march into chaos marked by a black wall with over 50,000 names engraved on it. Ironic to realize that the greatest of all American generations, the WWII generation mistakenly pursued the path of war in Vietnam. They thought they were doing the right thing.Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese were luminous in this film, and Robin Wright Penn was haunting as she mirrored almost every hippie girl encountered in the years from 1968 to 1978.....there is horror and humor and impossible coincidences as Zemekis' Everyman GI tries to get along in a post-American world. In the end it is the white feather of love and life that is blown into the blue skies of Alabama as Forrest watches his little boy get on the school bus.I realize I have now written of this movie, but I really sit and watch it speechless. When Forrest punches out the yippie freak who manhandles his beloved Jenny, and the lush jangle of Jim McGuinn's Rickenbacker 12-string announces the song ""Turn, Turn, Turn"", tears fill my eyes every time. One of the greatest match-ups of screen and music I've ever seen.Ecclesiastics, Pete Seeger and The Byrd's were right....to everything there is a season.... and in 1968, the season began to wane for the American Camelot. ""Forrest Gump"" should be preserved in a time capsule."
1 June 1999,Delightful!,,"I love this movie! so it's a little corny. It's rare to find funny and innocent anymore. Tom Hanks was really good. and I loved Bubba, Jenny, Dan, and the rest.  We even named our cat Jenny (pronounced Jen-nay).  I read the book 1st - and it was different.  worth reading. too bad Winston Groom didn't make the money Tom Hanks did!  I love the ""historic"" scenes - like when Forrest met the president.  and the part about Elvis is a hoot!  The amputee scene is ground-breaking technology, as is the mall in DC.  Love it, own it, thanks!"
9 May 2003,Best movie,,"I saw Forrest Gump for film study recently which was my first time. It's been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extroadinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites. I recommend to anyone."
27 September 2000,2 points regarding the power of this film,,"I want to make two observations that I have not seen in the over 160 reviews of this film that I just read on this site.1)  One thing that Forrest does not embody, something which our culture is drowning in, is sarcasm.  (For accessible examples, read many of the reviews for this film!)  That is one of the reasons people find it surprisingly moving.  If you watch a lot of popular movies, not to mention sitcom TV, you might think that sarcasm is the natural idiom of communication.  But then, when someone actually asserts something and takes a stand for something (other than self-seeking sex or egotistical domination) without a whiff of sarcasm, the effect can be stunning.We have forgotten that sarcasm is parasitic on somebody actually asserting something.  To cut through the garbage of life we should be able to distance ourselves from the false parts of it, and that is what sarcasm does.  But sarcasm cannot assert anything except its derision of someone else's assertion.  It is derivative and parasitic.  To see someone who is without sarcasm, as we see in Gump, can be an eye-opening and truly moving experience, opening us to a vision of life where there is something to believe in, and not just something to mock.This is not a question of Gump's (low) intelligence, though our culture often likes to think that sarcasm is the sine qua non of intelligence.  It is about a desire to commit and risk.  Sarcasm falls silent in the face of life honestly lived in adherence to values worth striving after.  Hence, all we are left with are tears when we see someone without sarcasm and guile who lives a life of loyalty and love.2) The recitation of recent history may seem a frivolous excuse for a few jokes, but the whole point of it detonates in the penultimate scene where Forrest talks to Jenny's grave.  He asks ""Is it Lieutenant Dan who is right, or is it Momma?"" (or words to that effect).  He is asking if we are all fated in a predeterministic way or if we are truly free to make our own destiny.  His answer--""I think its both""--rings true for many people, and hence is a powerful comment on all of life.  Both the capriciousness of history and a sense of something coming from it are acknowledged, and that speaks to me.The feather seems to be blown around randomly, but it comes to rest in strategic places.  God's grace works within the context of our human freedom, and, in the end, this is a film about grace."
30 April 2000,Great Movie,,"Personally, I think that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The drama aside, it still features some great comedy moments. The acting is great, and the plot is very interesting, and shows us how a man which considered to be an idiot by many becomes involved in many historical events without even noticing. A must-see for everyone."
2 September 2003,how can one so great act so dumb but great,,"I don't want to ramble too long like usual but I just want to try and express to far more experienced movie buffs than myself why i love this film.I rented Forrest Gump when i was about 10 years old, I don't know why it particularly stood out for me. I watched it and finished up crying I didn't know why i still wonder why I cried at it but now i realize it was pathos for that character which caused my tears. Back then, as i still am now I was popular, I didn't have great friend but i was/am well-liked (not sounding big-headed I hope), and now since becoming a part-time cinephile I realised the reason I love movies and love this movie was that it was taking me to new surroundings and as the tagline suggests see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump. I did that and enjoyed that insight and so enjoyed this film. I'm not gonna pap on about the plot because i always do that and I'm sick of writing spoilers all the time. I don't really think that this view will urge anyone to love this film but i want to say thislaters"
18 March 2000,"To sum it up in one word ""CLASSIC""",,This movie is very good. To this day I still consider it as one of the best movies ever made. If I ever have grand kids this is the movie I want to watch with them. This movie can be passed down from generation to generation and people of all ages will still love it!! It`s too bad some of the critics don`t know a classic when they see it.  Rating (best of five stars)...5.
20 September 1999,A movie about what life is REALLY about!,,"Forrest Gump holds a special place in my heart. My son is intellectually disabled and I hope his life will be a full as Forrest's (without going to war though....pass on that one!).The characters are all spot on. What young man hasn't been secretly in love with a ""Jenny"" who spurned his love when it wasn't convenient but needed it when the frivolous part of her life was over. The pop singer Prince once had a line in a song ""Life is just a party and parties weren't meant to last!"".From the passing of Forrest's mother to Bubba to Jenny Forrest outlived them all and was somehow a better person, a more complete human being for the experience.10/10 for a movie with heart.PS  The gunfire and napalm scenes in the jungle were brilliant!"
7 July 2002,"A brilliant movie, that can't help to move you",,"The first time I watched this movie, it passed straight over my head.  It takes time, to see what this film is all about.  The film is brilliant, because it starts of with a young boy, who is being told that he is not as good as the other children, because he isn't very clever.  His mum tells him he is as good as everyone else, and shouldn't feel inferior.  Forrest Gump uses his other talents and teaches by his mother to try his hardest at everything, and never looses faith and determination in anything that he did. This made him accomplish, so much when others would have thought he wouldn't do nothing with his life.People may see this film as a sentimental piece of trash, that makes us feel sorry for a idiot.  If you say this then you are not getting out of the movie what you should be doing.Tom Hanks is the nucleus of this movie, and played a brilliant part as Forrest.  I think Forrest, had a childlike innocence about him, which made him accomplish so much, because he only had the teachings of his mother to guide him in life, and he never saw the dangers, such has the war in Vietnam.The movie can't help to move you, especially when his mum and girlfriend dies, and when he finds out he's a father.  The movie has a brilliant sound-track, and never has a boring lull, it moves at a brilliant pace, and keeps you wanting more.I believe this is one of the great movies that has been made, because even though I am the biggest cynic of them all, even I cannot overlook the sheer brilliance, and imagination behind the movie.  This is a truly great movie that shouldn't be missed."
30 June 2008,Forrest Gump,,"""Forrest Gump"" is a story about a boy and later a man who has the IQ of 75, but even a person with normal IQ is not so noble. Forrest Gump stays true to himself till the very end of the movie thought he realizes that he is not as smart as other people. This understanding makes him able to accept anything that happens in his life and be ""strong"". The theme of ""Forrest Gump"" seems to be easy but at the same time it is very serious because it touches important issues such as war, not being like other people, fight for the right to be equal and many others. Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump. Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor that he gets into the skin of Forrest Gump's silly role. He expresses a wide range of emotion that I empathize with his acting. In the beginning of ""Forrest Gump"" -- ""Life's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."" This is with a young nurse gives a hint what the main actor's life will be. ). Forrest Gump is very strong as it strives for fighting the stereotype of discriminating disabled people. It may be said that it is one of the greatest movies"
22 November 2005,Greatly overrated mix-up,,"I must confess that the 2 first times I saw this movie (its theatrical release and its 1st television issue), I loved, even adored, this movie. But then, looking back more calmly, I started thinking: what does this movie really have? A mix of historical situations (in chronological order, of course), a lot of songs (especially from the 1960s & 1970s), an incredibly lucky idiot whose strange quote ""life is like a chocolate box"" entered cinematic pop culture and, behind it all, an irresponsible depiction of points of view (typicall from the 1990s). This movie was actually the perfect excuse to play a ton of oldies (remixed and remastered to fit the strange 1990s likes), use innovative technology (especially digital) to place this boy everywhere and revisit recent history. (Almost) nothing more, and nothing less."
28 August 2002,it Is unbelievable. unbelievably amazing...,,"After reading most of the IMDB comments about Forrest Gump I'd like to regard to some of the counterclaims (people who haven't seen this movie yet can read it too, there's no actual spoilers):The main problem of the people who disliked this movie is either they're way too sarcastic or just way, but WAAAY too ""literal"". All the comments of these people manifested one of those two. They just don't understand that the plot of Forrest Gump is almost totally figurative! I really don't get you people, Forrest Gump is not only unique, it EXQUISITE, it surpasses everything a good movie can be! If this isn't a 10+/10 movie, I don't know what is.When other movies poke you STRAIGHT IN THE FACE some reprimands, or moral lessons, or ""confrontations with God"", or personal life journeys, or dark sides of the world such as war, child sexual abuse, drugs etc., you grimace and say ""damn, another unoriginal preaching piece of crap"". But when you get Forrest Gump, the most genius movie ever that servers you all the above mentioned plus much much more in the most original, creative, imaginative, emotions-evoking way, you cavil and scorn it, say it is boring, implausible, ridiculous celebration of stupidity, has insidious offensive messages... Come on!The superiority of this movie is how it makes a fictitious, fantastic, improbable story almost a believable one. But let's say you don't believe, ok. Then you go and look for messages, and what do you find? Right-wing/American Dream propaganda? Patronizing southern/black/rebel people? Go on, dig some more, miss the real gist. Miss the opportunity to see what's our world like through the eyes of an innate virtuous man lacking grudge, greed and falsity, miss true love, honesty, loyalty, friendship, miss the force to overcome personal catastrophes, miss the different meanings of life, destiny, miss the MOST ORIGINAL CHRONOLOGY of the well-known American history events... and much more. Make fun of the inspiring scenes such as the cross-country running (& many more), the excellent scenes of Forrest's effects on the history, the funny scenes such as the smiley-face, or other exciting ones... if I continue, I'll write here the whole script! Every scene is brilliant, just BRILLIANT! I for one just can't help myself from admiring the one who created this story, this plot. it IS unbelievable. Unbelievably amazing.I won't detail my feelings and opinions about the movie, it's plot and symbols, it would be too much. I just hope all the people who patronize both the character of Forrest Gump and the spectators who loved the movie, will find also their EQ (Emotional Quotient), and place it somewhere beside their mighty IQ. Seriously, give it another chance from a different point of view. Please try.P.S: I can accept (just to accept, not to understand, not to agree) the opinions of those who disliked the movie - but the only one I just can't GET is the claim that Tom Hanks got an easy oscar. I don't know whether or not it's easier to act retarded, but I think this role was one of the hardest ever, and Tom Hanks has done it superbly! Even when Hanks isn't talking, his facial impressions are speaking instead (e.g. the can-touch-a-robot scene where he asks about the intelligence of his son).. His performance is just too real to call it acting. Gary Sinise and Robin Wright are magnificent to."
15 October 2004,The Hype,,"The hype said this movie would change you forever. The movie is unique in that it evokes laughter and tears at the same time and you feel both swelling up inside you and you literally honestly really don't know which will win out and come out first.The trivia section for this movie is ripe with clues that some people don't seem to get - but without getting them it's a mystery what people see in the movie. That a song called Blowin' in the Wind was written by Bob Dylan but the performer in the movie uses the stage name Bobbie Dylan - would this scene have any value, make any sense, if we didn't know that? It's clear that to some nuggets like this were pure revelation.As a keeper it's weak. You start to see where the story line is 'just a bit too thin', but this is the second Oscar in a row for Hanks (after Philadelphia) and no offense to the easily offended Hoffman, but this one takes a lot more work and talent than tilting one's head to the side and insisting there are 246 toothpicks on the floor when you really don't have a clue.Was released twice in the same year and cleaned up both times; won six of its possible thirteen Oscars; Hans Zimmer is good and his music was no exception in The Lion King, but it's a shame one can't give awards to all who are deserving: Silvestri's work on this one is some of the best of the past ten years."
30 May 1999,The greatest movie ever,,"This movie has it all:  romance, action, family, drama, war, violence, heroism, and, best of all, comedy.  It's not like Titanic and sappy all the way through.  It's not like Pulp Fiction and pure violence.  It's pure and innocent.  Forrest Gump shows the most innocent way of looking at life through the eyes of an idiot.  He sees beauty in its most natural form and only sees with his heart.  He seems to find himself meeting famous people but doesn't even know about it.  Gump just sees them as people.  He doesn't care if they're Elvis Presley or Lyndon B Johnson.  He sees through their fame and sees the people behind the face.  This movie can be summed up by a quote by William Shakespeare: Life is a tale Told by an idiot. And that is exactly what this movie has to offer.  Just remember to bring the tissues..."
26 March 2002,Wonderful!,,"I really do love this movie a lot. Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Hanna Hall were all brilliant! This movie is about Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) telling the story of his life while waiting for a bus. Robert Zemeckis directed the movie, and made it great! This is a wonderful movie! I give Forrest Gump a 10 out of 10!!! :)"
27 February 2000,Good but way overrated,,"I still don't understand what all the hype about Forrest Gump is all about. It's a good film, but REALLY! The cast is all good, with Tom Hanks in fine form as usual, and Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field are all very well cast. The best scene in my opinion is where Forrest tells Jenny that he knows what love is. A good movie but still too much hype."
27 February 2000,At Times Fascinating and Informative but Also Considerably Offensive,,"Perhaps the most interesting aspect in Forrest Gump is its various alternations of certain historical events.  While these scenes (presented in the fashion of archives) which center on interaction with numerous past famous people essentially appears to be contrived (not to mention that the film also could have gone further with the satire), this can also serve as some type of source for information on the United States and are amusing and inventive. The storytelling in general, feels like a way to provide some type of information and history of the United States at a certain period. But the film as a whole feels bloated, and along the way, some considerably offensive material can be found here and there.  At one point, there's a feeling that the script is trying to lay down a stereotype people based on the type of states that they live in.  The script in certain areas takes some humor and/or tries to create satire out of people with various physical disabilities along with seemingly attempting to create some humor out of a racial slur based on misinterpretation from the title character.  Certain points in the story are brought up in a relatively low key fashion but we still can help to come to a foregone conclusion on the meaning of the particular topics that are discussed.  Along with that, Forrest Gump occasionally aims for absolutely low brow humor rather than providing more necessary satire.  While the musical score makes for a good set piece, the drama to a certain extent can also rub you the wrong way.  It at times breaks down and treads into sappy territory and can also get pretty manipulative.  Take for instance a small reference to AIDS which by itself feels tagged onto the story."
11 August 2003,Shining over the darkness,,"Forrest Gump is touching to the melodramatic and sensitive.  Problem is, Robert Zemeckis is more concerned about glossing over the moments that viewers would find objectionable in order to make it more of a ""happy-family-safe-crowd-pleasing-money-maker"".  With Back to the Future and Death Becomes Her he wasn't as concerned about that, hence they were better movies.Such moments as drug addiction, exploitation, PTSD, the horrors of Vietnam, and the tirade of political violence that flows through the movie are done more for laughs or extracting faux-sentimental emotion from the audience rather than any actual history lesson in the works.  I can only imagine how Terry Gilliam or Oliver Stone of all people would have handled this.On the technical level, Forrest Gump is a trip.  As Zemeckis said, ""It's not trying to wow you"" and it doesn't.  CGI is used here the way it was supposed to, as a supporting element that enhances the experience.  The editing is also pretty good, many scenes flow into each other effectively and create interesting parallels.  Zemeckis also is finally concerned about what he puts on the screen, thus the cinematography is far better than anything else he previously did.  Hanks' performance is certainly inferior compared to Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  What was the Academy thinking?While some may wax nostalgia about the passage of time from the 50s to the early 90s in American history, I will try to be supportive of the fact that the film keeps moving.  Unfortunately, the message (and hence the purpose) of the movie is constantly hammered at the audience in a fashion that celebrates foolishness.  How uninventive from a Hollywood ""whiz kid"".Overall, halfway decent, albeit sugarcoated, film.  If you want real history, watch Schindler's List instead.  3 out of 5 stars."
2 April 2002,"Great Film, but...",,"I thought this film was excellent. It was heartwarming, funny and sometimes a little serious. Brilliant performances from Sinise, and especially Tom Hanks makes this movie even better, BUT... it did not deserve the best picture oscar. As good as it may be, it was not good enough. I would recommend this movie to everyone, but don't take the film too seriously - you might find it very stupid."
27 August 2003,Run To The Hills,,"Iron Maiden lead singer Bruce Dickson once said, ""If you're gonna die, die with your boots on.""  I feel much same way about Bobby Z's FORREST GUMP.  A pure star vehicle for Tommy Gun Hanks.  He basically plays Jesus Christ without the ability to be a pacifist all of the time; which, I will admit, at times is touching.  Especially when he watches Jenny (Robin Wright Sean Penn) play guitar at a strip joint, mistaking the event for a legitimate concert, and then slugging the skum balls that harass her.I also praise this picture for not being preachy.  It deals with large chunks of American history and treats them objectively, letting us decide what really was going on during such turbulent times.  Gary Sinise is also a charm.Unfortunately, huge parts of FORREST GUMP lack the firepower to keep us glued to the story.  As a result, we become bored and wonder when Bobby Z is ever going to have the guts to make a period peace that does not use the most cliched songs of all time.Ted's Grade: B-/B"
16 July 2001,The movie that never ends,,"I thought the movie was okay.  I don't know why it won oscars, maybe because it's an original idea?  As for Tom Hanks, I thought any other actor could've acted this role, it's easy to act ""retarded"" and to speak weird.  The movie became long after a while, I wanted it to end.  It's not because I wasn't liking it but they could've made it shorter.*Next paragraph is full of SPOILERS* The woman ""Jenny"" I didn't like her at all.  To me, she used Forrest all along.  First, she should've never accepted to take his medal of honor the first time (although later she gave it back).  Second, she left him many times and didn't want to marry him. And then, she took him back & wanted to marry him ONLY AFTER she learned that she was sick.  IMO, she married him just so that he takes care of her & son.  I just thought she didn't really love him and only acted in her own interest.Anyways, it's a good movie if you like the type."
7 January 2000,Classic Film!,,"Spoilers!First, it was a classic film, which should have won all the awards it did. Second - it could have been better.Gump is a tall tale, a cliched tour, of America from the 1950s through the 1980s. One man, a slightly retarded individual, named Forrest Gump, from the deep south of course, bumps into and/or is the cause of innumerable public events and incidents, decade after decade; each spiked with appropriate pop background music, from Hendrix to Fleetwood Mac. It's a bit strained to fit as many pop culture references into the life of one man, as with the back to back t-shirt episodes of the running man, Gump. But, generally, it works - except:Except that as with any tall tale, the how, why, and wherefore is always glossed over. How could he be so utterly unaware of himself and his place in publicized events, year after year? How could he run coast to coast and back again? and is that considered interesting (it's a slow point of the film). It's a joke, here, pathos there. It's a laugh at the Black Panthers - shown as ignorant, tedious and boring demagogues, who lecture a man who, under both enemy and friendly fire saved the life of his best friend, a black man - a laugh at the SDS - shown as basically a trendy, superficial and messed up Bohemian - the March on Washington crowd - 'offing the pigs' while hastily presenting a man who utterly opposes their agenda - the Mr. Goodbar disco set - bunch of licentious druggies, and no more - and so on and so forth. For those whom the anti-war crowd and Mr. Goodbar were heroes, this film must be like a knife in the side. But it's not really anti-liberal, or conservative, so much as it remains a tall tale and a platform for almost sketch comedy, but based on what the writers knew or esteemed, which would seem to be liberal causes mostly - so those are what wind up getting skewered.The pathos is suggested in Gump as the 'little child' of Scripture - to be as the child, to accept others, to be uncritical, to always believe, and the like. He never holds a grudge. He always want to believe the best of others. He transforms Dan's life, and presents the most emotional moment of the whole film when Dan comes to visit for the wedding, between Gump and his doomed wife, Jenny - and is able to walk on artificial limbs, obviously happy to be alive.However, Gump isn't really a child. A while his acceptance of others is laudable, the reason is still that of incompetence. He literally doesn't know enough not to be naive. He doesn't have a choice - and it's not a choice he makes, therefore. Add to the fact that his entire life is really a series of screenwriter's jokes. He simply cannot appreciate what he's done, or why. It's all a blur of events which he relates in the most alienated, and disconnected fashion. It's only to contradict the story so far when running man, Gump, remarks on the beauty of a mountain reflecting on a lake below, or the momentary pause from the rain in Vietnam. It's like two different people, but the simple, and gentle man, not really involved in his own life, is the one seen through most of the film. Real people who have mental disabilities, supposedly as Gump, could appreciate the sunset over a lake, and could express a far wider range of emotion than the emotionally stunted Gump. Had they made the simple man more aware of himself, more human, it would have been a much better film upon repeated viewing.Ultimately, it could be the writers present a message they didn't intend to. Gump is great not just because good things happen to him, even in desperate situations, but because he has not convinced himself, as the boomers around him have in this film, that life is not only not like a box of chocolates, because there must be some planning and goal setting in life, but that life is just one long stumble after another through cheap slogans and debilitating drugs. One stumbles through nature, friends, wealth, awards, and accomplishment. Thinking itself so much smarter, the other just stumbles, and is not even to be pitied for it. It's a message film, to be sure. But the message can get lost in the humorous tall tale, because in that sense, it's almost two films, instead of one."
7 May 1999,A very original movie.,,"This movie is everything entertaining,funny,touching and insightful. Tom Hanks is amazingly charming as Forrest and you'll truly feel like you have made a special friend by the end of the movie. Enjoy this one,its quite different from the usual crap Hollywood puts out ,so go see it and love it!"
22 September 2004,Great,,"Tom Hanks gave his the best acting in this movie. All the situations that he is put into. We all know that this can never happen but, FORREST GUMP could. From going to the Vietnam war, owning his own shrimp boat, and meeting the president again. This movie when i first saw this movie i didn't really get I just thought it was just another movie about someone life but, when i saw again I got a different perspective of it. You can be a nobody and turn into a somebody. But enough sentimental stuff. It also had its comedy like "" Are you stupid or something""? ""Stupid is as stupid does sir"". It also a movie about love. He was the greatest. I mean what wouldn't he do for jenny. Great movie."
17 August 2022,8,,"It was a great experience watching this film. Tom hanks gave a wonderfully charming performance.The relationships forrest had with his mom, bubba, lieutenant dan all felt very genuine and heartfelt."
17 November 2018,Life is like ..,,"I really enjoyed this movie it was released the year I graduated H.S. and how funny was it to tell someone RUN Forrest, Run."
27 July 2021,Amazing,,I watched this movie in 2021 and it was great. I was crying for the last 90 minutes.
29 October 2018,Great Movie,,I fell in love with this movie the very first time that i seen it. Its a must watch movie.
1 July 1999,"emotional, comical, spectacular, fantastical and unpredictable",,"What more do you want from a movie than to be taken down emotional roads where good values win true? What more do you want from a movie than a real good laugh? What more do you want from a movie than spectacular scenery and classic direction? (What spectacular war scenes!)The dream of what might be, depicted through fantastical events is pretty good - isn't it? (a main theme here is the underdog winning and being cryptically involved in world renowned events) What more do you want from a movie than unpredictable twists and turns in a plot? All of these factors keep us going to the movies.Forrest Gump fits and exceeds all of these moulds; it truly rates as one of my top ten movies (of the last forty five years)."
13 April 1999,"forrest gump is a good movie, plain and simple",,"i liked forrest gump. it was a very smart,and well-crafted movie. it pretty much has it all. i was pretty shocked by this movie. i thought it was another big hyped-up movie,but it wasn't. it was a good movie. people can talk bad about this movie all they want. they're maybe the same people that believe movies like psycho,rocky,and the texas chainsaw massacre are classics please.now those movies are movies that are over-hyped,and highly overrated.i give forrest gump *** out of ****"
4 February 2004,One of the best movies I've ever seen,,"---WARNING MANY SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW--- I would have to say that Forrest Gump is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie will make you laugh and it will make you cry. The fact that Forrest is telling you his story while sitting at a bus stop is an excellent idea. Tom Hanks is the best possible actor to play Forrest Gump, his caring soul and simple outlook on things is truly touching. He lives an incredible life, and he isn't able to realize it, often causing laughter to result. Gary Sinise is perfect for the role of Lt. Dan. He nails, and steals, each scene he's in, and in my opinion, he steals the movie as well. When you see Lt. Dan walk up with his fiance, close to the end, with his new metal legs, it brings me to tears. So does the scene when Lt. Dan has finally accepted what happened, isn't angry anymore, and you see him swimming under the sunset. It's such a touching moment, when you finally see the man Lt. Dan used to be.  Also, when Forrest sees his son for the first time, the shock and love on his face, and the grief he has on his face at Jenny's grave. Bottom line, I love this movie, and I give it 10 out of 10 stars."
17 April 2022,Revil foot steps with down to earth Forrest gump,,All of a sudden he's athenker and swers him self with baking then think. He realy had no chides comments in now of his seen s high modern day life was not for him in his mossion picture movie night was good to the title of inter itelegence seems an serin.
19 December 2019,Best Film Ever,,"Best Film i've ever seen, this movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone."
18 September 2002,"Such a huge, historical movie.",,"****Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, and Sally Field.A rather unintelligent man makes history as the decades pass by.  He does all sorts of stuff.  'Nam, Watergate, JFK, college football, etc.  The movie is such a huge and beautiful historical movie that will always be remembered in most people who had watched this hearts."
8 February 1999,Worth every Oscar,,"This movie was great. It was funny, it was dramatic and it was romantic. It's great because Forrest experiences so many historic events and sees historic people. It's just so great."
21 October 2000,"One Of The Best Fictional ""Biographies"" I Have Ever Seen",,"Sometimes....you have to see the world with a child like mind. Take away the worries and stresses of today's fast paced world and just.....look. See what you're missing.While I watched this movie.....I WAS Forrest. I BECAME Forrest. I thoroughly enjoyed it.I read the comments below by Mr. Ben Morgan  and I tend to disagree with many things.I also saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".""The Shawshank Redemption"" was just plane------bland.""Pulp Fiction"" was just plane------stupid.Neither one of those movies compared to ""Forrest Gump"", even though they were all three nominated for awards in 1994.Mr. Morgan claims in his comments that in years to come, the Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction will be looked upon much more favourably than the over-awarded Forrest Gump.Well....here it is six years later. Forrest Gump is talked about more than either of those two movies. Don't get me wrong, okay ? The other two are talked about, but Forrest Gump will hold the hearts of people more than those two ever will."
3 November 2000,A big meal that's easy to digest but nonetheless delicious,,"OK, unlike some of you, I am not going to slam this film out of anger just because it beat out ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on the 1994 awards circuit.  Yes, this film was made with broad eyes and simple minds.  Yes, it partially served as a candy-coated time capsule for those narcissistic baby boomers.  Yes, as usual, the film is loaded with Zemekis' right-wing ideals clumsily disguised as cuddly Hallmark Card sentiments. One thing that may have bothered people is how American this film is.  It is SO American, so much so that I ask you to think of a recent film that is so American that isn't completely set in some military environment. Nonetheless, I loved the epic scope and reach of this film.  It restored my belief that people still want to make ""magical"" films.  The breadth of this film is as close to an old MGM musical as we're going to get these days.I don't think Tom Hanks was playing over-the-top (that endeavor belongs to Al Pacino), he hit the note just right with his mix of innocence and morality.  Gary Sinise got damn lucky with this film.  Like Richard Gere, Sinise suffers from the John Travolta syndrome; they're all good actors who have a habit of picking bad movies.  But Sinise must have known how juicy this role was, his poker-face reaction to the New Year's party is just incredible.  Robin Wright-Penn also gave a great performance, and you have to give credit where credit is due; The role of Jenny is one of a few female characters in film whose purpose of existence is not defined solely through the male lead (although her story is chronicled on a separate timeline than Forrest's).  The Bubba character was given a good dose of sympathy to prevent him from becoming a Southern country-boy caricature.  And his friendship with Forrest demonstrates an indifferent towards American racism that only a child is capable of (also remember, these two guys are from the South).  I was most impressed with the song medley they concocted for the running sequence.  The scene takes place in the late 70's, and they choose all these classic 70's songs that have themes of movement or travel (""Go Your Own Way,"" ""Running On Empty,"" ""On The Road Again,"" ""Against The Wind""). It is all edited together quite wonderfully.  I'm not a huge Zemekis fan (I think his Spielbergian tendencies are a little obvious at times), but this is a beautiful film."
23 July 2003,An ordinary man,,"I think that TV Guide (wasn't it?) summed the movie up very well, when they said this movie was about the adventures of an ordinary man. The film was kind of an homage to what can just plain happen to anyone. Who could ever be entertained (or forget for that matter) the wily accent Forrest Gump had in this movie? This was released in 1994. That was a very good movie year. This and ""The Mask"" (another favorite of mine) came out. They slowly showed how Gump was expriencing the important elements and occurings of the 20th century. I once went to a restaruant that was completely devoted to Forrest Gump. I think it was called ""Bubba's Grill"" or something like that, and they showed all the things featured in the movie. Like all those drink bottles that Forrest drank that caused him to say ""I got to pee"" to president Kennedy. You could never forget the various ""words of wisdom"" in that movie (""What's vacation?"" ""It's when you go to a place and you don't ever come back"" ""My mother always says, stupid is as stupid does"") Another favorite part was the subplot with Lieut. Dan. With he lost his legs and years later, you see him a better man with metal legs.This was based on a book. A writing teacher of mine, Mrs. Olmar said FG was the only movie based on a book that was better than the book. She said in the book, Forrest went into space with a monkey and a woman(!). The floating feather effect was nice too. Tom Hanks is another favorite actor of mine, with his roles in movies like FG and ""Toy Story"". Anyway, I'll give it a 9/10. Really nice movie.Forrest Gump: (talking about president Kennedy) Then they shot him, and a few years later, they shot his brother."
19 August 2021,Outstanding Film,,"A beautiful film about life, love, and perspective. I watch it every year."
7 September 2020,Amazing classic,,"Amazing classic. Reminds me of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". How does a child view the adult world?"
12 February 2009,Intriguing Social Satire with good production values,,"This is an intriguing social satire in the guise of a quirky comedy-drama. Tom Hanks is good but his performance wasn't award worthy. The film takes a (MINOR SPOILERS) conservative view of American politics but it is deeper than its critics suggest. In fact, the film pokes fun at the average person who goes through life blissfully unaware of the importance of events happening around him/her. The Special Effects are effective and the period detail impeccable. There is an affecting moment earlier in the picture which brought tears to my eyes. Despite its over length and dull mid-section, its worth watching.Overall 7/10"
17 August 2004,His gift from God was that he could RUN. - POSSIBLE SPOILER -,,"This movie is out of this ENTIRE world! Wonderful script, and a really remarkable story about a mentally handicapped man, who met three presidents, ran back and forth through America for four years, became a millionaire, saved his entire squad in Nam, was a pingpong champ, responsible for Watergate, the smiley logo and the S**T HAPPENS slogan. Elvis took his moves from him, for crying out loud! Also very beautiful is that romantic part with Jenny throughout the entire movie. He falls in love with her, and also does she make him to run, and then the miracle happens: HE CAN RUN! She is his shining light throughout the movie. I only sometimes feel sorry for Gump that he doesn't know what horrible tramp Jenny has been before she joins with him. I think Jenny feels sorry about this too. I guess Forrest doesn't, and that's good. What you don't know can't hurt you, I guess, and Forrest doesn't deserve to worry about things like that. All in all a GREAT F*****G MOVIE! I really don't know what to say any more! I'm out of words! There's only one word I still would like to cry out: FENOMENAL!!!"
25 October 2018,A Classic,,"This is an awesome movie, probably one of my favorites"
20 September 2018,:),,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it.
22 January 2023,"Dumb Protagonist, Genius Writers",,"""The dumb character who unexplainably succeeds all the time is one of my least favorite. This film manages to pull it off because gump's successes feel earned and realistic. This film also knows just how long to dwell in the status put before moving on and feels considerably shorter then the actual run time would entail. Overall, this is a great movie, it does what it does pretty well and not much more then that. It's not like this thing is a master class of cinema, it is simply a good film. My opinions on this film are not to intricate, this film is simple and it is content being so. Yet it tackles so many frets of life.My Rating: 78."
19 January 2022,Mom won't teach you anything bad,,"Today we will talk about one of the best films in the world from 1994 to the present day, which left a deep mark in the hearts of millions of viewers - ""Forrest Gump"".""Forrest Gump""The storyline of the film revolves around the main character - the mentally retarded Forrest Gump. On the one hand, this is a man with mental disabilities, but on the other hand, this is a unique person whose superiority sometimes cannot be compared with an ordinary person, whose kindest heart gave birth to the most amazing deeds. Despite the health problems, this unique character has won many victories in life, which is impossible for a healthy person. He became the best amateur athlete of the USA in football, a hero of the Vietnam War, also Gump won an international table tennis tournament in China, and made a great contribution to the lives of many people by donating to the construction of a church and a medical center. How does Forrest Gump manage to achieve such results? Maybe thanks to his wise mother, who."
26 December 2001,Forrest Gump not great? I don't think so!,,"I have to comment on Mr. Ben Morgan's review of Forrest Gump.  He called the movie a dupe because of its over-hyped publicity and positive reviews, and gave reasons why he felt the film was not great, but instead ""just above mediocre"".  However, his reasons did not prove to me that the film was not great, it just proved that this is not the kind of film that he enjoys. Using his logic, I could say that Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was not a great film because I do not enjoy movies with sub-titles.  This of course does not prove that the film is not great, but rather proves that it's just a film that I wouldn't enjoy personally.Forrest Gump is not an exercise in mush and sentimentality, as Mr. Morgan put it, but rather a well-directed, well-acted masterpiece.  It is a coming of age story about a man who succeeds in each phase of life despite obvious disadvantages.  It has a wonderful story, a top-notch soundtrack, and fantastic images of war, post-war, and 1960's through 80's America."
22 August 1999,Please....,,"This film is a major piece of drivel. Its popularity is an alarming sign of the ""dumbing down"" of art, thought, taste and education. It is no wonder that it made many millions and is so well loved. At least it was Tom Hanks who made the millions and not Charlton Heston. Harrumph!!!!!"
10 February 1999,definitely entertaining,,"The acting is great, the FX are great, the story is great, it's entertaining, I laughed, I cried, it became a part of me, and it will be a classic for a long time to come.But it didn't deserve Oscar honors over the Shawshank Redemption, which was, by far, the more important film."
29 December 2019,Best movie i ever watched,,Well it is my best movie watched i enjoyed this movie lot.Tom hanks as forrest gump acted very superbly movie is about the polio affected boy and his hardships with his legs and then he join army fought in vietnam war and final part with his son .
5 January 2019,Amazing,,"This movie it's so great !! The main characters is fantastique et play amazing, i love it."
22 June 2008,A Masterpiece that should be recognized for years to come....,,"I will start off, this film is truly captivating. The character of Forrest Gump is so well thought of. It is a symbol for hope. The performance done by Tom Hanks is one of the best I have seen. First off, it gets a lot of hate around here, but the truth is, only a great actor could pull it off.Tom Hanks did amazing as the mentally challenged man. The way the film starts off, it is sort of a 'fairy tale'. Yes, it seems a bit theatrical at times, but this is the whole tone of the film. the film is trying to teach us more. the film is trying to pull the audience in an emotional way, and let me tell you, it does. We can really feel for every single character. The mom tries to do what every other mom tries to do these days. She is trying to raise her child the best way possible, in all means trying to keep him away from the cruelty of the world. This film represents life in a sort of light and innocent way, mainly because it is told from Forrest's point of view. The other characters, Forrest's friends that interwine in his life, Bubba and Lt. Dave, are all very well-rounded. They represent other symbols. The performance given by Gary Sinise is perfect. he perfectly captures his character's struggles. He is a very confused and 'bad' character in a way, but the way Forrest changes him and gives him hope is truly inspiring. The other character who I also think is sort of dark in a way, is Jenny. Jenny represents a lot of people these days. No, she is not 'evil', but like a lot of people these days, she is lost and doesn't know who she really is or what she really wants to do. her journey throughout the film is also very developed, and the actress playing her, Robin Writh Penn did a great job. Sally Field, of course, is great and wimsy and perfect in her performance.What is amazing in this film is not only the unforgettable characters and the amazing screenplay, but also the amazing cinematography and sets. The setting designs are so well put together, yes, they look very realistic, they are. It fits well with the tone of the film. The direction is also amazing. It really gives us thought to the characters, as does the pace of the wonderful film editing. The music scores used are simply fantastic, as they also represent the whole feeling of the film.At the end of the film, I found myself overly emotional at all the scenes. Not only because of the well put ending, but because I just remembered the whole journey Forrest Gump had. You simply cannot be in anything but simple 'awe' over the film. You realize how much you care about all these situations and characters. At the end of the day, this film is what every film should be. Give us a little bit of unfamiliar realistic life lessons, give us the truth in a not so disturbing way, but also simply gives us hope and uplift the audience(Forrest Gump's run across American is one of the best single moments in cinema history). This film is simple perfect, and it really surprised me. Perfect film-making."
14 June 2004,"Not bad, but definitely no masterpiece",,"This movie is a great example of right-wing sophistry. It asks us to believe that it's best to just unthinkingly act according to our own moral inclinations (assuming, of course, that they are the product of simple and well-off Christian upbringing), and put blind faith in the existing order, which will of course self-correct if it ever errs. It glorifies the vast accumulation of wealth because you will of course share it around, and treats military service as an inevitability not to be questioned.Now in all fairness, this is an oversimplification of the film's message. If this had been all there was to the film, it would likely have been a box-office bomb and generated as much negative feedback as it ultimately did positive. But this is the core of the film. The best that can be said for it is that it delivers this conservative message with several liberal flourishes, making it politically intriguing.For example, the single mother who gets her unqualified son into school by having sex with the principal hardly squares with the kind of persona one would usually attribute to a 50s woman who is horrified by Elvis's pelvic antics. And it is to the film's credit that while it implies stupidity to be useful in all aspects of life, it explicitly states that it is your best friend in the military. The film does vilify a lot of the youth protest movements of the 60s, but it also seems to take a sardonic glee in Edgar Wallace being shot, and it plays for laughs Forrest Gump showing his ass to Lyndon Johnson. And note the photo of Marilyn Monroe in JFK's bathroom.On paper, this would sound like an explosive movie, but most people seem to take it as just a harmless and fun experience. No doubt this is because of the core element -- Tom Hanks's performance. And honestly, this is excellent. Hanks makes Forrest Gump likable and sincere in a way few, if any, other actors could have. My personal Tom Hanks heaven will always be G.H. Dorr, PhD, from The Ladykillers, but this is deservedly some of his best-known work."
16 October 2022,Greatest screenplay ever written?,,"Forrest is a feather flowing through America. The path is neither set nor should it be, but it's flow in our system and country makes it so that an average joe can have a beautiful life.Be kind, run fast and don't take things too seriously. This movie encapsulates the American experience in an ironic sense in that we are all simple people (for the most part) making the best of the times we are in. The only transcending experience we have is love.My family watches this movie ever thanksgiving after a loss in the family. It is the best ""family"" movie in the IMDB top movies based on their current ranking.Not a beat is missed throughout the whole movie and Zemeckis does a great job but Roth's script is consistently moving the pace faster without dropping an emotional beat."
12 April 2002,quite a journey,,"Tom Hanks is riveting as a naïve, slow-witted southerner who, despite the obstacles that life continually throws at him, experiences years of history without ever fully realizing the significance of the changing times around him. His powerful, emotionally in-depth journey takes him through the bitter integration of public school systems, an unexpectedly glorious college football career, a tour of duty through Vietnam, and fame and fortune as an unlikely shrimp boat captain, all the while staying true to his uninformed but gripping will and determination. Takes its time to unfold, but the result is a well-crafted, insightful, and in-depth historical journey played to perfection by a nonpareil Hanks and his talented co-stars; simply wonderful. ***½"
12 March 2022,A unique classic.,,Loved the the powerful storytelling with the juxtaposition between Forrest's past and present as he talks about his life at the bus stop and eventually living his story in the present until the end. The cinematography was amazing with the vintage style.
27 January 1999,Forrest Gump: The kind of Genius we REALLY need!,,"First of all, Forrest Gump was an excellent film.  The emotions was real, the action was real, the characters were real, and plausible, some coincidences were extreme, but did nothing to hurt the movie.People seem to be angered at the fact that the character of Forrest Gump attains so much success, let alone his lack of ""intelligence.""  I believe this is the point that the author tried to make.  Forrest Gump may have had a childish, naive common sense, but he succeeded anyway, and with flying colours.  His innocence kept him from being tempted by greed, thus hurting himself and others. Honestly, if there were more Forrest Gumps  around, the world would be a better place (don't mean to sound sentimental).All the characters are used well to convey the image of the time.  Forrest's mother, and old-fashioned, good-hearted lady is typical of the time.  Jenny, falling into a drug crazed orgy during the seventies, pays for it by contracting AIDs a plausible fate for her actions.  Lieutenant Dan, a typical war vet, whom sees no reason for life without the ability to be normal shows us how to respect life in it's fullest.  Bubba, the sentiment character who is killed in battle at Forrest's side, leads to further events in the story well.The theme of success, happiness and awe of the world is well portrayed in the ""running"" scene where Forrest runs across america twofold.And possibly the most subtle, yet important theme of running away, is used with excellence.  From ""Run Forrest, Run"" to the scene with Forrest carrying Bubba from battle, to the football antics, and finally the ""Run across america"" scenes are genius.   Forrest was always a good runner, running away from his fears, running away from himself and running away from the truth. The one thing he did not run away from was Jenny, in fact he was running to Jenny. This emotional love-story may be a little ""storybook"" but it shows the power of love in everyone, even the handicapped.This film was excellent, I don't see how anyone could give it anything under 7/10 stars.I personally give it 9/10."
5 September 2004,Silly but superbly crafted ramble through US history,,"""How do we provide a US history lesson, warts and all, that is both entertaining and sentimental?"" may have been the question the script writers/producers asked themselves and settled on a slightly mentally and physically retarded boy in (of course) bigoted Alabama who just happens to later be present in most of the momentous occasions in US history of the second half of the 20th century. Well he doesn't stay physically retarded for very long, quite the opposite. We get to see to see quite a few American icons (OK, John Lennon was English, but like some of the other notable people we see he got assassinated by a mad gunman.) The film manages to maintain a didactically neutral attitude towards the events and people it shows - the facts alone - but is heavy on sentimentality, which no doubt is good for box office takings. Inane it certainly is, but has excellent set design and cinematography, has good flow, and great songs on the soundtrack. Worth watching. 8/10"
11 October 2021,Sci-Fi ?,,"Three stars are only because of great acting by Tom Hanks who manages to persuade majority of audience that being mentally handicapped is actually desirable trait.But, even after he magically survives War as a hero, plays pingpong like a pro, learns everything without problem and becomes rich fisherman, he still rides in bus just to show viewers his disability. Still not enough smart and rich to buy a car even if he really needs it?Congratulations mr. Hanks, you might even consider selling refrigerators to Eskimos."
15 December 2002,A Brilliant Triumph!,,"This is one film I must call a brilliant triumph.  It is the simple story of a simple man, who through dumb luck, becomes a multi-millionaire.  He never forgets the love of his life and he ends up marrying her in the end.I am not an emotional person, but I get tears in my eyes every time I watch the ending of this movie (when Forrest is standing at his wife's grave.)  I am not a fan of sequals, but I would love one made of this film.  Forrest Gump II, I feel, would be equally enjoyable.  Overall, I would rank this one in my top five films of all time.  A remarkable film."
25 June 2007,Forrest Gump,,"I watched this film ten years ago but it is still in my mind obviously.This is not an action or horror movies which are usually attractive. It is just a story,but a amazing story about amazing person.His name is Forrest Gump. He is not a normal person because he is, well somebody assumes that,very dumb. Certainly, that is not the main aspect of the movie. Forrest Gump make his life become a modern fairy tale when from a disable child to the famous footballer and soldier. In his mind,nothing important than his mother and Jenny, his closet friend and loved girl friend.Forrest Gump never use violence to solve problems.However, he did it one time because one stupid guy insult Jenny.I really like his sentence, ""I don't know what is love,but I love you."" The lesson I took from this movie and Forres Gump personally is we can do anything we want. Do not hesitate,whether our decision is right or wrong,just do it.It will help us to be more mature.I like this film very much because it is so humane"
6 March 2004,Give Me A Break,,"Come on who would ever watch this movie it's totally impossible and not to mention stupid.  First of all the army would never let a mentally retarded person enlist, and second of all how is a person of his mental state suppose of graduated college?  The straw that broke the camals back for me was when the news reported on Gump's running across the country and they reffered to him just a gardner from Greenbow Alabama, when he was a college football star, Medal of Honor winner, on the U.S. ping pong team, was on the cover of Fortune 500 (magazine), and sold his company to Macantosh for millions of dollers, give me a break.  For this to win the acadamy award is an utter joke."
25 October 2002,and that's all I have to say about that,,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** *****SPOILERS FOLLOWING*****Forrest Gump is an epic journey of a movie.Narrated throughout by Tom Hanks,who,in what has to be his best acting role ever,plays the gullible yet wholly lovable Forrest Gump. The movie begins with a thirty-something Forrest sitting on a park bench waiting for the number 7 bus.A feather falls at his feet and he picks it up and puts it in an old book he is carrying.This simple visual moment is the basis for the movie,it is a physical metaphor for lifes journey,and for the next 142 minutes we are voyeurs into the trials and tribulations of this simple-minded man from Greenbow Alabama. Our insight into Forrests life begins with him needing a contraption to help him walk when he is all of six or seven.A portly Doctor explains to the boys mother,played by Sally Field,that:Well...his legs are fine Mrs Gump,but his back is as crooked as a politician.And so poor Forrest has to wear steel leg braces that look simply 'chaotic'.The screenplay utilises this device to create a simply brilliant scene where Forrest seems to teach a young Elvis Presley his now infamously risque dance moves while staying in their mansion-like homestay.Forrest narrates this from the park bench to total strangers who are also waiting for a bus.He talks in a manner that suggests he thinks it's no big thing.His indifference causes disbelief in some of the strangers as he continues on with the story of his remarkable life. On the bus to school one day(when he is still very young) he meets a young girl named Jenny,who,in time becomes his one true love and an integral character in the story.'Me and Jenny was like peas and carrots' explains Forrest.'We did everything together'. Forrest gets older and becomes a football star after discovering his talent for running,and discovers that,in their late teenage years,he and Jenny aren't that close anymore.Having had an abusive childhood Jenny has trouble with commitment and stability,but knows what she wants from life.In a poignant and somewhat humourous scene in her secular school dorm she explains:I want to be a singer Forrest,like Joan Biaz.on a stage,just me and my guitar'. Forrests eventful life continues on and we see him involved in a scene where there is racial tension at his school and where,because of his achievements at football,he gets to meet President John F Kennedy.Both of these scenes are unique as Tom Hanks was actually added into the actual footage of these events as they really happened by computer technology.Both are extremely amusing scenes. The Vietnam War erupts and Forrest is conscripted.Just before he goes he finds Jenny singing in a seedy nightclub and rescues her from a group of obnoxious men,for which she is not impressed.She tells him she wants him to leave her alone.'I'm going to Vietnam...Jenny.I'll write you everyday'.And being a man of his word he does,amidst the graphic and relentless turmoil of the war.Gary Sinise puts in a star performance as Lt.Dan,a wily but genuinely nice character. Forrest befriends a negro by the name of Beauford Blue,who is affectionately called Bubba.His obsession is shrimp,and all he does is talk about it.His dream when leaving the army was to start a shrimping business.He asks Forrest if he'd like to be his partner and he obliges.Then one day the platoon is wiped out.Lt.Dan loses his legs and Bubba dies in Forrests arms.Recovering in hospital after being 'shot in the butTOCKS' Forrest learns that none of his letters to Jenny ever reached her-she had been travelling from city to city doing drugs and generally mixing with the wrong people. Forrest then becomes a professional table-tennis player while Lt.Dan,now in a wheelchair wallows in self pity.The two reunite one day in New York when Lt.Dan finds out Forrest was awarded the Congressional medal of honour for bravery after saving his companys lives in Nam.Forrests charmed and simple view on life eventually leads Lt.Dan to change his own outlook and together they begin trawling the ocean for shrimp in a boat called 'Jenny'.They succeed in their venture. Forrests life is not all wine and caviar though(or should that be shrimp?)as his mother passes away from cancer.Jenny returns but she is an emotional mess.Out walking one day they end up at her old home.Crying she throws stones at the now derelict house before collapsing onto the ground.Forrest narrates:'I guess sometimes there just ain't enough rocks'.Their relationship stays rocky,then one morning after making love,Jenny runs away.Forrest is devastated and takes up running-clear across the country! The film drifts back to the present day where Forrest is still waiting for his bus.After a disbeliever walks away laughing an elderly lady tells him she thinks it was a lovely story.Forrest explains he's on his way to see Jenny,the lady then tells him he doesn't need to catch the bus;the place he is looking for is only four blocks away. Forrest is reunited with Jenny who now seems to have her life in order.But there is a surprise ahead,she has a child.Forrests child.Initially shocked Forrest soon accepts this new responsibility as Jenny reveals she is dying,(we are left to assume from A.I.D.S)Inevitabley she dies and Forrest assumes the role of Father to young Forrest(Hayley Joel Osmont.) The movie ends at it began,the feather escaping from the book and gently flirting with the breeze up into an azure Alabama sky.Truly a magnificent movie.10/10."
22 February 2002,Forrest Gump - an epic of human proportions,,"Every review I've ever read of this great flick has always said ""well-meant but flawed.""  That's bull!  How flawed can a movie be when it takes a man through college football, Vietnam, ping pong, shrimping, and running several times across America?  Everybody from Elvis to Abbie Hoffman to Nixon to Kennedy to John Lennon to Dick Cavett to Lyndon Johnson make surprising and pleasant appearances.  While the film may be slightly exaggerated to keep this guy moving, the two hours of film ""Forrest Gump"" uses are spent giving us the best summation of pop culture and textbook history we're probably ever going to see.  And through it all, Forrest continually turns to his best friend Jenny, who sees Forrest as a good friend who doesn't know any better, which is why she tries so hard to maintain her innocence around her IQ-troubled friend.  While Forrest may never fully realize the 30-something years of history he encounters, he does recognize friends and family as the real center of the world, which is played out beautifully in the last scene, which hands the baton to a new generation of kids who may be more socially aware than their parents.  ""Forrest Gump"" is a must-have for anyone who enjoys people and movies."
12 July 2021,Tom hanks is amazing..,,"Tom hanks is amazing.. he is an actor who has already proven this by winning 2 Oscars in a row.. also, the movie is a very effective comedy-drama movie.. a few scenes will definitely be remembered.. it is not a very striking, hard movie, but with its plain narration, it has this strong effect. Can provide.. 10/10."
19 February 2006,great movie,,"if anyone says this movie is bad.... you can just ask them to watch movies of aliens and predators and all those cgi trashes... or else, not to watch anything at all. coz they don't deserve watching this kind of movies. This one is strictly for lovers of good movies. When I first saw it, I was attracted by the way Gump loves his girl. She tries to drift away from him again and again, but his love makes her come back. his love is unconditional. He didn't care what he gets back. He just love the girl... thats it. Above all, tom hanks, gary sinise, and others hv dished out magnificent performances. I hv watched the movie again and i would recommend those who hvnt seen it to GO WATCH IT!!! coz its worth. Moreover, its not just a good movie, its HIGHLY entertaining and u can learn a lesson or two from watching it."
23 June 2002,A Wonderfully Delicious Box of Chocolates,,"Life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. This movie is the same thing, a box of chocolates, and a very sweet and touching one. This movie was a surprise from beginning to end. Some parts were full of action and suspense, others were full of laughs and hilarious situations, others are full of tears and are very heart warming. The story is all about a guy with a low I.Q.(but a big heart, if you do not mind my saying so) survives through history in the United States. It is a very sweet movie, and this Forrest is a very sweet character, and I like that he is played by Tom Hanks. This movie is a Wonderfully Delicious Box of Chocolates.10/10."
23 February 2003,A very touching story,,"I rented this film and thought it was touching. It starts out with Forrest talking to an Afro-American lady on a park bench and offering her a chocolate and told her a story about his chldhood he told her a story about a pair of magic shoes, how he constantly wore medal wires and had a pair of crutches, and how a School rejected him. The last story he told the lady was how he met his special friend Jenny on a bus. Forrest and Jenny tought each other tricks and had to find ways to avoid 3 bullys. One evening Forrest was hiding in somebodys car but Jenny found him and took him into her house. Then Jenny was performing at a karaoke bar and he thought someone was trying to attack Jenny. For help finding out the right thing to do Forrest went off to join the army. When he returned home his mom and Jenny we're waiting. Forrest and Jenny we're eventually married. Then a guy left him and Forrest was in tears and said he would be the one to turn to if he ever needed anything."
25 June 2003,There's a little Forrest Gump in all of us,,"After a bout of depression I indulged in a moment of quiet self-reflection, and I remembered how Forrest Gump ran across the United States and simply rationalizes the trend he set: ""I just felt like running."" Some things are best done and for reasons we don't know why and I think a simpleton personality like Forrest's is something adults overlook and take for granted.He represents a symbol of how losing self-consciousness is often the road to happiness and also that living is of just doing and not questioning ""why?"" all the time. Of course, it would be near impossible for the resume of events to occur in the life of one man, but the message reaches to everyone who got into decisions attributed to pure innocence and good heartedness and came out triumphant. Reminder that there's a little of Forrest in all of us- a balancer of the often-serious life society dictates the selfish messages of ""survival of the fittest"". Good messages to anyone who needs a little boost to a bad day."
30 August 2003,How to take a great novel and butcher it to pieces,,"LET ME SAY THIS: WATCHING AN IDIOTIC FILM VERSION OF A GREAT BOOK IS NO BOX OF CHOCOLATES. This movie is (quite possibly) the WORST adaptation of a book to a ""film"". When it was first announced that Forrest Gump was going to be adapted for the screen, I was very excited, as this was one of my favorite stories. I cannot begin to describe the nausea that overcame me as I sat through the slaughter of Winston Groom's literary masterpiece (tall tale of the tallest). I was completely embarrassed in front of my friends (whom I had dragged along to the movie theater with me); I had to urge them to read the book and forget what they had witnessed on the screen. Everything about this movie, from the casting to the ""rewriting"", was just plain wrong. It was as if the powers that be at the studio were waiting for someone in the audience to jump up and say: ""THE EMPEROR IS NAKED"", but(secretly) knew that the sheep would even eat weeds."
13 February 2021,Amazing!,,"Tom Hanks is widely regarded as one of the bets actors of all time and one of the main reasons is his versatility in acting. This movie proves that, in my opinion this is Tom Hanks' best performance, he is incredible and not only that but the directing from Robert Zemeckis and the acting from the rest of the crew, this movie is incredible and is one of the greats, worth watching and if you want to understand a huge part of pop culture and film!"
7 July 1999,more points about this movie,,"i saw this movie for the first time in a long time a few weeks ago. and i like it better now than i ever did. the movie is just great. it's a movie that has it all. it's funny at times,and very touching. in my opinion it's one of the best,if not (THE)  movie of the 90's! tom hanks is very great in this movie. to me it lives up to every bit of it's hype it got. it's a remarkable achievement. the movie just touched me so much when i saw it a few weeks ago for the first time,in a long time. it's a truly unforgettable movie. it's become one of my favorite movies of all time.i love this movie,and always will. i give forrest gump **** out of ****"
18 April 1999,Tom Hanks makes it work,,"Some of its critics say that ""Forrest Gump"" is little more than a right wing fable whose message is ""Vote Republican.""  Yes, Forrest is the embodiment of ""traditional values,"" a simpleton who worships God, honors his mother, does what he's told, and never asks questions.  Good old Forrest succeeds in life by embracing the values of mainstream society while  Jenny, the girl he loves with a blind passion, pursues the fancy-free lifestyles in vogue at each time period portrayed:  In the 1960s, she joins the counterculture, strumming a guitar, smoking dope, dropping acid, and protesting the war in Vietnam in which Forrest courageously fights.  In the 70s, while Forrest is a successful businessman, Jenny is a fast living, sexually promiscuous member of the disco set.Forrest represents America, or, rather, the America that right wing propagandists want everyone to believe is the true America.  Do what you're told, never talk back, and you'll be successful and happy.  Jenny, on the other hand, epitomizes rebellion and the rejection of the unthinking way of life that the government would prefer we pursue.  Forrest is good.  Jenny is bad.  Forrest further strengthens his image of goodness by always, always, ALWAYS taking Jenny back whenever her latest flirtations fail to fulfill her.  Like Jesus, Forrest loves Jenny unconditionally, never questioning her lack of faithfulness.  Yes, this film says, America forgives all of you long-haired, dope smoking, draft-dodging sex perverts, or we will if you agree to shape up, and fast.  For Jenny, however, it was too late.  Once she settled down into a respectable middle-class life, her past caught up with her.Of course, some people see the above interpretation  as hogwash.  They maintain that ""Forrest Gump"" is simply a fable promoting such tried and true values as honoring your parents and your God.  It's the story of innocence uncorrupted by a greedy, frequently hateful and dishonest world.  No matter how evil the times, goodness can prevail.I must say I can relate to the criticisms; they have validity. But so do the arguments of those who champion the film.  It is with the latter group that I side, and Tom Hanks, more than anything else, is the reason.  Not since James Stewart has an actor so believably portrayed kindness and decency. Hanks makes this film work, and his performance can even help you overlook the often awkward special-effects (the scene in which Forrest appears on ""The Dick Cavett Show"" with John Lennon failed to convince).  I think Morgan Freeman deserved the Oscar that year for ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but of all the people who took home Oscars for ""Forrest Gump,"" no one earned theirs more than Hanks.  I can't imagine another actor (a living one, anyway) taking on this character and pulling it off as splendidly as he did."
20 June 2002,How can anyone dislike this film?!,,"This film has everything that a person could want; action, romance, sentiment, comedy and yet people still slate it, I really don't understand! This is one of my favorite films of all time, and Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors of our generation in my opinion and so I find it very difficult to see why people dislike it so much. The storyline itself is great, it's brilliant in its simplicity - basically the story of a young boy's life, and the amazing things he does with it. Each character brings something else to the story that adds to its brilliance and all the actors in it play their parts with the utmost talent, especially Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. As many of my friends know, I often watch this film burning with fury at Wright's character Jenny and the way she treats her supposed best friend Forest, and that is the sign of a good actress; someone who can really make you feel emotion towards the character they are playing. The same principle can be adopted with Tom Hanks; the first time I saw him sitting on that famous bench at the beginning, I felt a lump in throat. You cannot help but like the character, and no-one could have played him as well as Tom Hanks did. This film is a masterpiece, and one of the few truly good films of recent years. It deserved every Oscar that it received and I suggest to all those who don't like it, you must be missing something, as in my view it is impossible to not enjoy this film."
10 June 2021,Forrest gump,,This was and great movie. Everything behind moment about life.
21 July 2002,no feelings...,,"to all you people who hate this movie: what is wrong with you?  Do you have any feelings at all?  Ok, I know Forrest is supposed to be kind of retarded but can't you overlook that?  Can't you see the beauty and the inspiration of this movie?  Forrest Gump is an excellent movie, one that I'll never, EVER get tired of.  Every time I see it, it just gets better and better.  It hurts to see that some people just do not have any feelings or sentimentality."
21 October 2021,Life is like a box of chocolate,,"This my first time whatching this movie and to my dsurprise I like it, at first I had to what it because of my engliesh teache, but i don't regret it watching it. So teacher if you read this thank you so much for showing me this movie.But straight to the point, I liked this movie because first of all it wasnt as other movies related to the past, this one had more thing to which you should pay more atention as well as it let you learn some valuable thing about life. For example one of this was the phrase ""Life is like a box of chocolate"", at first I didn't understand the meaning but after a lot of thinking I got to the answer and it right no body nows our future even us we all get something different and just destiny and god are the ones in charge of it or so that my thought about it.But it not only this thing that took all my atention also the part of ""I just feel like running"" was another phrase that I wanted to discover its answer but until now I don't find it. Also another thing is that this movie apart from phrases with something behind them show me the true meaning of love and what it is to be in love.But what I am trying to say is that this was one of the best movies I have watched even thought it talked some past history I still liked, I will recommende it to all those peopel that want to learn valuable thing but at the same time enjoy whatching a movie."
30 March 2003,A good film is a good film,,"It makes you feel good. Isn't that enough? You may think I'm wrong or whatever but all the 'it means this, it means that' stuff is ridiculous. Stop looking for every political point or secret influence. Its fictional, we know that, it takes you on a journey and you enjoy it, if you didn't then, well, I sorry for you!"
17 January 2011,you can't get better than Forrest Gump.,,"It is a movie you'll laugh at and cry,but it teaches the story of life. Forrest is a man of his word and though he's not too smart he has a character that is true and good-hearted.Tom Hanks acting is unbelievable and how the filmed John Lennon talking to Forrest after already being dead ill never know.The story to it that touches you is he impacts history and achieves so many things, but cares so much about Jenny, he just wants to get to see her.Forrest Gump is a movie you won't forget easily. I don't get how anyone doesn't like this movieMy rating:**********""Mamaw always said life is a box of chocolates; you never know what your going to get."""
27 August 2004,A nice film,,"Because I play a lot music for myself and do a lot of composing, I always listen to the score in every film I see, and the score in this film is by Alan Silvestri, and he's done a pretty good job. Especially the piano-theme in the beginning when we see this feather blowing through the air. ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get"", Forrest says, sitting on a bench talking to strangers. Strangers who listens to this guy telling his whole story. And the story is quite good. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job playing Forrest, and there' s actually a good reason why he was awarded with an Oscar for this role. The Director Of Photography, Don Burgess has also done a good job in this film, because some of the scenes in this film is like watching a beautiful painting or going to a museum. Very nice! Everyone out there who likes good films with a good story should definately see this film.Regards from Mr_Villmark"
15 November 2021,wonderful,,"What a story , with hopes and with dreams of a boy that goes trough life and wins !This is a history lesson as well a life lesson ! I never get tired of seing it !Fantastic performance of all !"
9 May 2003,Best movie,,"I saw Forrest Gump for film study recently which was my first time. It's been on T.V. before but I guess I was too young to appreciate or understand it's content. And now, I know what a great movie this is. Not only is it humourous, funny and heart-felt(is that a word?), but it's inspiring and entertaining and has good messages in it. Tom Hanks who I am now a big appreciative fan- is such a brilliant actor. He's amazing in all his roles and as Forrest Gump he was extradinary. I've seen also quite  alot of his movies- Green mile, catch me if you can, Toy Story 1 and 2, you've got mail, castaway  but not really appreciated this fine actor. I mean with all the new generation 'heart-throb' actors who I like also and enjoy alot watching. But Tom has the experience. I have the DVD(2 disks) and it has everything, screen tests-which are sooo cute with Little Haley Joel Osmont and special effects which are so clever. I never really noticed how much work went into this and where it is computer generated you don't even notice.So, I give this movie a 5/5. It is a classic and one of my favourites. I recommend to anyone."
9 January 2000,Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar!,,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It made me laugh and cry, but it also made me think.  Forrest might have a low IQ, but yet, he smarter than most people I know.  He knows it's not right for Jenny's boyfriend to hit her.  He's also very loyal.  Even though Lieutenant Dan gives Forrest a hard time, Forrest always stays his friend.  He also keeps his promise to Bubba, by starting the shrimp business.  Finally, he's always loyal to Jenny, the love of his life.  She changes with the times, but Forrest always waits for her.  Also, when Forrest goes to visit her grave, he leaves the note that young Forrest wrote to her.  He told his dad not to open it, so he didn't.  That too shows that Forrest keeps his promises.Just when I thought that Tom Hanks's performance in ""Philadelphia"" was his best, he comes out with Forrest Gump.  He is one of the best actors today, if not the best.  ""Forrest Gump"" is a movie you'll want to see again and again...it's a masterpiece!"
